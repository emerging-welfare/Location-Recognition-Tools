At O

an O

of O

Gmail O
has O
been O
a O
popular O
success O

Just O
this O

Google B-ORG
gave O
many O

another O

speculate O
that O
it O
could O
be O
the O
start O
of O
Gmail O

final O
move O
out O
of O

Their O
marketing O
was O
absolutely O
brilliant O
: O
Simply O
through O
association O
with O
Google B-ORG
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
invitation-only O
membership O

they O
created O
a O

something O
so O
in O

invitations O
went O
for O
$ O

on O
eBay B-ORG

one O

even O

the O
most O

story O
to O

The O

she O
is O

I O

Sure O

Auburn B-ORG

out O

this O

the O

seems O
like O

I O
seldom O

I O
always O
root O

The O
game O
is O
big O
enough O

it O

even O

when O

when O

he O

he O
was O

I O
think O
he O
got O
that O
. O

Sue O
Yes O
, O
he O
did O
. O

Ben O
Um O
, O
there O
was O
a O
show O
here O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
at O
a O
big O

I O
think O
maybe O
it O
was O
at O
Lincoln O

in O
the O

or O
the O
Metropolitan O
Opera O
House O
or O
the O
New O

something O

Arafat O
came O

The O
mayor O

New B-LOC

, O
who O
was O

Rudolph O
Giuliani O
, O
stood O
up O

walked O
out O

he O
was O
also O
in O
attendance O
, O
and O
his O
, O
uh O
, O
comment O
to O
the O
press O
afterwards O
was O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
he O
just O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
honor O
a O
terrorist O
, O
and O
I O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
few O
things O
that O
I O
was O
happy O
about O
with O
Giuliani O
when O
he O
was O
mayor O

Sue O
Mhm O
. O

Ben O
Uh O
, O
Giuliani O
got O
very O
popular O
later O
because O
of O
the- O
the O
Sue O
Nine O
eleven O
. O

Ben O
World O
Trade O

thing O
but O
he- O
he O
was O
n't O
so O
popular O
as O
a O
mayor O
. O

Sue O
Yeah O
. O

Right O
, O
I O
knew O
that O
. O

Ben O
But O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I- O
I O
kind O
of O
agreed O
with O
that O
Arafat O
thing O
, O
though O
. O

I O
-- O
but O
I O
do O
think O
he O
accomplished O
something O
in O
that O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
do O
have O
a O
legitimate O
grievance O
and O
he O
put O
it O
on O
the O
map O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Sue O
Well O
, O
he- O
-- O
he O
did O
but O
I O
think O
he O
really O
failed O
miserably O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
when O
he O
, O
um O
, O
refused O
to O
sign O
that O
treaty O
that O
was O
originally O
set O
up O
because O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
-- O
option O
and O
it O
really O
could O
've O
re- O
done O
some O
wonderful O
things O
for O
his O
people O
and O
I O
think O
he O
really O
did O
them O
a O
disservice O
by O
not O
taking O
care O
of O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Ben O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Yeah O
, O
what O
was O
the O
treaty O
? O

I O
'm O
not O
familiar O
with O
it O
. O

Sue O
Well O
, O
um O
, O
where O
they O
were O
going O
to O
, O
uh O
, O
give O
them O
, O
like O
, O
ninety-six O
percent O
of O
the O
Ga- O
of- O
of O
Gaza B-LOC
and O
he O
said O
that O
he O
wanted O
all O
hundred O
percent O
. O

And O
so O
he O
refused O
to O
sign O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
an- O
an O
incredible O
faux O
pas O
on O
his O
part O
, O
from O
my O
opinion O
. O

Ben O
Oh O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
y- O
it's- O
it O
's O
-- O
you O
have O
to O
sometimes O
take O
a O
little O
bit O
less O
than O
you O
want O
, O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
an- O
and O
ninety-six O
percent O
is O
a O
big O
percentage O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Sue O
Yes O
. O

And O
I O
think O
that O
could O
have O
really O
done O
some O
wonderful O
uh O
steps O
for O
-- O
uh O
for O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
uh O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

And O
I O
felt O
-- O
very O
sad O
that O
, O
um O
, O
that O
that O
was O
n't O
-- O
done O
. O

It O
really O
should O
've O
been O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
unfortunate O
that- O
that O
he O
-- O
that O
he O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
, O
um O
, O
step O
forward O
-- O
to O
do- O
do O
what O
was O
really O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
his O
people O
. O

Ben O
Sometimes- O
sometimes O
I O
th- O
I O
think O
it O
's O
hard O
when- O
when O
you O
're O
the- O
the O
first O
leader O
, O
or O
the O
George O
Washington O
of O
something O
, O
to O
see O
things O
other O
than O
in O
black O
and O
white O
. O

You O
know O
, O
or O
maybe O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
gift O
of- O
of O
nuance O
that O
would O
've O
helped O
him O
to- O
-- O
to O
take O
that O
right O
step O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the- O
-- O
the O
-- O
his O
people O
suffer O
so O
terribly O
and O
maybe O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
he O
had O
signed O
that O
, O
huh O
. O

Sue O
I O
really O
think O
so O
. O

I O
really O
, O
truly O
do O
and O
now O
it O
's O
a- O
a O
situation O
where O
, O
with O
his O
passing O
, O
um O
, O
I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
real O
, O
um O
, O
new O
opening O
, O
a O
new O
possibility O
for- O
-- O
some O
extremely O

steps O

out O

this O
-- O
I O
do O
think O
that O
the O
United B-LOC

-- O
will O
probably O
be O
requested O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O

and O
I O
understand O
that O
, O
I O
me- O
uh O
, O

, O

, O
I O
think O

both O
sides O

have O
a O
trust O
in O
the O

that O
make O

stuff O

uh O
-- O
That O
's O
why O
we O
should O
be O
there O
but O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O

we O

an O
area O
which O
has O

that O
I O

work O
either O
in O
these O
areas O

Insurgents O
west O
of O

quite O
obstinately O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
nothing O
but O
full O
control O
of O
the O
country O
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
Anbar B-LOC
governorate O
, O
will O
satisfy O
them O
. O

They O
have O
refused O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
political O
process O
, O
they O
have O
repeatedly O
announced O
their O
intentions O
to O
boycott O
the O
elections O

to O
disrupt O
them O
in O
other O
areas O

The O
demands O
of O
the O
Fallujah B-LOC
negotiants O
from O
the O
government O
weeks O
ago O
were O
obscene O
and O
they O
clearly O
reflect O
the O
overt O
sectarianism O
and O
regionalism O
of O
the O

groups O
in O
the O

The O
demands O
were O
not O
released O

the O
Iraqi B-LOC
public O

the O
time O
for O
unkown O
reasons O

they O

they O

They O
said O
the O

look O
what O
the O

us O

He O

the O

earlier O

the O

Loren O

called O
it O
a O
`` O

worrisome O

'' O
though O
he O
said O

would O
be O
more O
puzzled O
than O
alarmed O
. O

`` O
What O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
is O
a O
fairly O

Thompson O

Michelle O
Malkin O
has O
a O
post O
about O
this O
today O
where O
some O
outlets O
have O
stopped O
selling O

Lots O

people O
think O
that O
these O
indeed O
might O
be O
loonies O
playing O
with O
new O
Christmas O
toys O
but O
I O
disagree O
. O

These O
are O
incidents O
where O
the O
Airplanes O
were O
tracked O
, O
some O
as O
high O
as O
8500 O
feet O
. O

To O
track O
a O
fast O
moving O

at O
that O
altitude O
would O
not O
be O
some O
toy O
you O
can O
get O

In O
my O
opinion O
this O
is O
quite O

some O
of O
it O

this O
threat O
. O

Instead O
, O
a O
menu O
of O
options O
may O
be O
considered O
, O
including O
installing O
infrared O
( O
IR O
) O
countermeasures O
on O
aircraft O
; O
modifying O
flight O
operations O
and O
air O
traffic O
control O
procedures O
; O
improving O
airport O
and O
regional O
security O
; O
and O
strengthening O
missile O
non-proliferation O
efforts O
. O

Equipping O
aircraft O
with O
missile O
countermeasure O
systems O
can O
protect O
the O
aircraft O
even O
when O
operating O
in O
areas O
where O
ground-based O
security O
measures O
are O
unavailable O
or O
infeasible O
to O
implement O
. O

However O
, O
this O
option O
has O
a O
relatively O
high O
cost O
, O
between O
$ O
1 O
million O
and O
$ O
3 O
million O
per O
aircraft O
, O
and O
the O
time O
needed O
for O
implementation O
does O
not O
allow O
for O
immediate O
response O
to O
the O
existing O
terrorist O
threat O
. O

Procedural O
improvements O
such O
as O
specific O
flight O
crew O
training O
, O
altering O
air O
traffic O
procedures O
to O
minimize O
exposure O
to O
the O
threat O
, O
and O
improved O
security O
near O
airports O
may O
be O
less O
costly O
than O
countermeasures O
and O
could O
more O
immediately O
help O
deter O
domestic O
terrorist O
attacks O
. O

However O
, O
these O
techniques O
by O
themselves O
can O
not O
completely O
mitigate O
the O
risk O
of O
domestic O
attacks O
and O
would O
not O
protect O
U.S B-LOC

airliners O

it O

quite O
a O

whether O
it O

a O
good O
atmosphere O
and O
also O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
i- O
know O
who O
who O
really O
is O
in O
charge O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
and O
know O
who O
you O
have O
to O
answer O
to O
. O

Because O
sometimes O
, O
y- O
I O
I O
I O
did O
I O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
a O
company O
that O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
was O
a O
subs- O
s- O
captive O
sub-contractor O
for O
making O
packaging O
material O
. O

And O
, O
um O
, O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
salesmen O
in O
the O
company O
, O
they O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
was O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
chain O
of O
command O
, O
you O
might O
say O
. O

You O
know O
, O
there O
was O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
person O
that O
was O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
head O
of O
the O
organization O
. O

But O
, O
all O
the O
salesmen O
-- O
used O
to O
come O
around O
and O
give O
orders O
, O
too O
, O
you O
know O
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
kind O
of O
difficult O
for O
the O
m- O
for O
my O
employees O
, O
because O
they O
would O
the O
salesmen O
would O
be O
coming O
out O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
without O
consulting O
with O
the O
one O
that O
was O
in O
charge O
. O

They O
would O
just O
be O
coming O
out O
and O
giving O
orders O
when O
they O
should O
already O
went O
through O
him O
. O

So O
it O
made O
it O
difficult O
. O

So O
I O
I O
I O
think O
it's O
really O
important O
to O
h- O
have O
that O
really O
clear O
. O

That O
that O
there O
's O
some O
organized O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
, O
uh O
, O
problems O
and O
orders O
and O
things O
like O
that O
, O
and O
if O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
, O
then O
-- O
you O
go O
to O
the O
person O
who O
's O
in O
charge O
and O
-- O
then O
they O
can O
handle O
it O
. O

So O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
that O
that O
's O
just O
a O
you O
know O
, O
a O
-- O
previous O
, O
uh O
, O
type O
of O
work O
that O
I O
had O
. O

And O
I O
and O
tha- O
I O
think O
that O
's O
what O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
talk O
about O
, O
too O
, O
right O
? O

Alexander O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
that O
's O
that O
's O
I O
think O
it O
's O
just O
basically O
, O
is O
( O
( O
) O
) O
one O
of O
the O
things O
I O
perceive O
is O
if- O
what O
kind O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
environment O
is O
it O
, O
and O
is O
it O
inviting O
is O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O
all O
that O
they O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
what O
they O
're O
aiming O
at O
. O

You O
know O
, O
it O
's O
not O
a O
place O
where O
everybody O
trying O
to O
give O
instruction O
and O
everybody O
trying O
to O
do O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Uh O
, O
but O
I O
for O
my O
job O
is O
i- O
i- O
-- O
we O
have O
us O
a O
very O
diverse O
feel O
. O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
are O
from O
different O
country O
, O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
they O
are O
pretty O
much O
accepting O
, O
and O
I O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I- O
bas- O
basically O
you- O
you O
can O
promote O
yourself O
if O
you O
do O
a O
good O
job O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
pick O
and O
choose O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Bill O
Right O
. O

Alexander O
It O
's O
a O
very O
-- O
environment O
that O
allows O
you O
to O
grow O
in O
. O

And O
I O
think O
they O
thinks O
I O
rightfully O
do O
n't O
, O
if O
-- O
like O
if O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
, O
like O
, O
I'll O
freshly O
go O
to O
my O
team O
lead O
or O
the O
supervisor O
and O
she O
takes O
it O
to O
her O
boss O
, O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
the O
boss O
takes O
it O
to O
the O
next O
level O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Bill O
Right O
. O

Yeah O
, O
but O
that O
-- O
I O
feel O
like O
that O
that O
's O
very O
important O
. O

Uh O
, O
for O
a O
company O
to O
be O
well-run O
, O
it O
has O
to O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
c- O
it O
's O
t- O
has O
to O
be O
able O
to O
send O
a O
clear O
message O
-- O
as O
to O
how O
to O
handle O
problems O
and O
who O
who O
is O
the O
one O
that O
's O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
indicated O
for O
-- O
for O
those O
problems O
-- O
to O
handle O
. O

And O
and O
people O
-- O
those O
in O
the O
company O
need O
to O
be O
um O
instructed O
-- O
to O
know O
wh- O
where O
their O
relative O
place O
is O
in O
the O
company O
. O

So O
that O
they O
they O
do O
n't O
overstep O
their O
bounds O
. O

Alexander O
Yeah O
. O

Bill O
Because O
when O
that O
happens O
, O
and O
it O
that O
makes O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
creates O
problems O
for O
the O
employees O
. O

It O
makes O
them O
discontent O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
if O
they O
if O
they O
can O
be O
, O
eh O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
jumped O

arbitrarily O
by O
just O
about O

then O
pretty O

you O

they O

they O
're O
they O
're O
not O
going O

Now O
, O
I O
don't O
expect O

when O

every O

somebody O

It O
should O
n't O

either O
, O
since O

Peterson O
Trial O
Scott O
Peterson O
has O
been O
found O
guilty O
of O
murdering O
his O
wife O
Laci O
and O
their O
unborn O
son O
, O
and O
he O
now O
faces O
the O
death O
penalty O

Do O

guilty O
of O
the O
crimes O
he O
's O
been O
convicted O
of O
? O

If O
so O
, O
what O
were O
his O
motives O
? O

How O
closely O
did O
you O
follow O
the O
trial O
and O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
all O
of O
the O
media O
coverage O
of O
the O
trial O
? O

What O
kind O
of O
sentencing O
should O
Peterson O
receive O
? O

Hillary O
Hello O
. O

Kelly O
Hello O
? O

Hillary O
Hi O
, O
my O
name O
is O
Hillary O
. O

Kelly O
Hey O
, O
hello O
. O

My O
name O
's O
Kelly O
. O

Could O
you O
hold O
on O
for O
a O
second O
? O

Hillary O
Sure O
. O

Kelly O
One O
, O
okay O
. O

Hello O
? O

Hillary O
Mhm O
. O

Kelly O
Hillary O
? O

Hillary O
Yeah O
. O

Kelly O
Hey O
, O
yeah O
, O
okay O
. O

Hillary O
It O
's O
uh O
Kelly O
So O
the O
Hillary O
a O
pretty O
-- O
depressing O
topic O
for O
today O
. O

Kelly O
yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
so O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
much O
about O
that O
topic O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
really O
follow O
the O
trial O
very O
closely O
at O
all O
Hillary O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
, O
uh O
, O
cable O
so O
we O
purposely O
did O
n't O
watch O
the O
trial O
, O
but O
I O
read O
about O
it O
on O
the O
internet O
. O

Kelly O
so O
Hillary O
and O
basically O
Kelly O
Oh O
, O
really O
? O

Hillary O
he O
-- O
killed O
his O
wife O
when O
she O
was O
-- O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
and O
-- O
and O
dumped O
her O
in O
, O
uh O
-- O
the O
ocean O
, O
basically O
. O

Kelly O
So O
why O
was O
it O
so O
special O
? O

Why O
did O
that O
, O
uh O
-- O
particular O
case O
make O
-- O
the O
the O
national O
news O
? O

Hillary O
I O
think O
it O
's O
because O
it O
was O
in O
such O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
, O
um O
Kelly O
Like O
Hillary O
it O
was O
-- O
in O
such O
a O
quiet O
, O
upscale O
community O
where O
it O
happened O
and O
-- O
um O
just O
I O
think O
the O
fact O
of O
her O
being O
eight O
months O
pregnant O
, O
um O
, O
drew O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
and O
Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
of O
course O
people O
were O
worried O
about O
her O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
then O
they O
found O
her O
and O
blah O
blah O
blah O
. O

It O
was O
-- O
gossip O
, O
basically O
. O

Kelly O
( O
( O
Yeah O
, O
right O
. O
) O
) O

Oh O
, O
but O
the O
mistress O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
murder O
? O

Hillary O
I O
think O
-- O
yeah O
, O
cause O
he O
found O
out O
, O
they O
found O
out O
he O
had O
a O
mistress O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
like O
, O
oh O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

Are O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
, O
but O
who O
knows O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Kelly O
Right O
. O

Hillary O
very O
sad O
cause O
she O
has O
a O
child O
herself O
and O
so O
she O
drug O
her O
son O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
uh O
, O
drama O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
part O
of O
. O

Kelly O
Wait O
, O
what O
happened O
? O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

She O
has O
a O
son O
too O
, O
so O
he O
he O
also O
got O
put O
-- O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
spotlight O
a O
bit O
, O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
TV O
though O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
. O

Kelly O
Oh O
, O
the O
son O
of O
the O
, O
right O
right O
. O

Hillary O
of O
-- O
of O
his O
girlfriend O
, O
yeah O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
hear O
though O
, O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
-- O
the O
first O
person O
to O
be O
( O
( O
) O
) O
um O
-- O
uh O
-- O
killed O
for O
a O
crime O
in O
California B-LOC
in O
like O
, O
thirty O
five O
years O
or O
something O
. O

Oh O
. O

Kelly O
Oh O
, O
really O
? O

Hillary O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
've O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
've O
-- O
um O
-- O
given O
him O
the O
death O
penalty O
yet O
. O

But O
I O
think O
he O
would O
be O
the O
first O
in O
, O
in O
a O
really O
long O
time O
to O
actually O
-- O
be O
killed O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
amazing O
. O

Hillary O
I O
don't O
Kelly O
Um O
-- O
why O
, O
uh O
, O
now O
why O
did O
they O
decide O
that O
this O
was O
to O
be O
this O
big O
( O
( O
) O
) O
out O
of O
this O
with O
the O
most O
heinous O
crime O
in O
all O
of O
California B-LOC
? O

Hillary O
well O
, O
you O
know O
Kelly O
I O
mean O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
not O
how O
they O
decide O
who O
died O
, O
but O
it O
's O
because O
of O
the O
Hillary O
you O
know O
, O
and O
Kelly O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
cou- O
, O
like O
the O
-- O
the O
court O
that O
they O
went O
to O
, O
like O
the O
area O
doesn't O
Hillary O
well O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
they O
decided O
on O
this O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
so O
public O
of O
a O
case O
. O

But O
they O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Kelly O
Yeah O
. O

Hillary O
they O
have O
many O
many O
worse O
crimes O
going O
on O
in O
California B-LOC
, O
parents O
killing O
their O
children O
and O
everything O
, O
that O
you O
would O
think O
-- O
would O
would O
, O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
be O
Kelly O
Hearing O
more O
. O

Hillary O
be O
more O
Kelly O
Stringent O
penalties O
, O
Hillary O
yeah O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
, O
they O
ignore O
those O
because O
this O
one O
got O
on O
television O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

Kelly O
keep O
like O
-- O
uh O
, O
the O
jury O
from O
watching O
~TV O
and O
the O
media O
and O
stuff O
. O

But O
I O
guess O
now O
( O
( O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
) O
) O
-- O
pretty O
much O
impossible O
-- O
to O
do O
. O

Hillary O
I O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
never O
really O
got O
the O
whole O
-- O
watching O
it O
on O
~TV O
and O
and O
getting O
into O
the O
whole O
-- O
mystery O
of O
it O
because O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
the O
woman O
's O
dead O
and O
so O
is O
her O
child O
and O
-- O
and O
-- O
there O
's O
-- O
really O
no O
way O
of O
changing O
that O
I O
guess O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
strange O
how O
it O
was O
so O
publicized O
. O

Like O
I O
'm O
just O
, O
seriously O
, O
like O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
like O
I O
try O
not O
to O
watch O
, O
like O
-- O
too O
much O
, O
like O
Hillary O
You O
ca O
n't O
help O
it O
sometimes O
. O

Kelly O
Yeah O
I O
know O
. O

But O
it O
just O
amazes O
me O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
ridiculous O
how O
publicized O
-- O
how O
much O
publicity O
it O
got O
because O
-- O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
like O
human O
rights O
violations O
going O
on O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

I O
mean O
there's O
like O
, O
genocide O
in O
Sudan B-LOC
right O
now O
but O
like O
, O
nobody O
talks O
about O
that O
. O

That O
's O
like O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Hillary O
Oh O
yeah O
and O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
, O
I O
know O
and O
people O
-- O
flock O
, O
flock O
to O
the O
store O
to O
buy O
all O
their O
-- O
all O
their O
foreign O
made O
goods O
and O
it O
's O
like O
what O
are O
you O
-- O
doing O
? O

Obviously O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
about O
what's O
going O
on O
. O

They O
just O
like O
to O
hear O
the O
details O
. O

Maybe O
if O
they O
could O
hear O
the O
details O
about O
other O
things O
they O
would O
be O
more O
involved O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Kelly O
Um O
( O
( O
) O
) O
it O
's O
almost O
like O
, O
uh O
-- O
( O
( O
) O
) O
diversion O
but O
it O
just O
seems O
like O
they O
just O
make O
it O
into O
like O
, O
like O
a O
soap O
opera O
for O
people O
to O
watch O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Hillary O
Well O
you O
know O
, O
some O
people O
were O
glued O
to O
their O
~TVs O
for O
weeks O
, O
and O
it O
's O
just O
to O
disturbing O
that O
that O
would O
be O
their O
-- O
their O
main O
entertainment O
during O
the O
day O
. O

Kelly O
Oh O
yeah O
, O
definitely O
. O

It O
's O
creepy O
. O

Hillary O
Especially O
when O
there O
's O
so O
many O
other O
things O
they O
could O
be O
doing O
. O

We O
have O
three O
kids O
. O

I O
could O
not O
sit O
around O
all O
day O
and O
watch O
a O
murder O
trial O
on O
~TV O

especially O
with O
my O

ran O
a O

the O

in O

a O
real O
story O
, O
they O
're O
all O
hanging O
out O

it O
looks O

though O
the O

in O
one O
of O

shots O

trying O

us O

who O

the O

apparently O
, O
you O
can O
get O

you O
can O
not O
nurse O
a O
chicken O
. O

bill O

there O
you O

the O
question O

what O

you O

a O
chicken O
can O
not O
be O
nursed O
. O

only O
mammals O
that O
have O
distinct O
biological O
feature O

chickens O
are O
also O
the O

the O

our O

here O
is O
the O
explanation O

this O
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

any O
farm O
kid O
knows O
that O
certain O
animals O
can O
not O
see O
for O
a O
few O
days O
after O
they're O
born O
, O
including O
puppies O

the O
puppies O
try O
to O
nurse O
the O
chicken O
hen O

they O
do O
that O
by O
feel O
, O
not O
sight O
. O

a O
chicken O
hen O
is O
warm O
and O
comfortable O
, O
so O
they O
try O
their O
luck O

eventually O
feel O
their O
way O

'' O

Yet O
Putin O
has O
been O
far O

reserved O

He O

his O
loyal O

suggested O
Friday O
that O

be O

`` O

Jacques O

central O
role O
for O
the O
United B-ORG

a O
post-war O
revival O

The O
call O
reflected O
the O
insistent O
demand O
made O
by O
the O
three O
leaders O
before O
the O
US-British B-LOC

But O
the O
Saint B-LOC

summit O
ended O
without O
any O
formal O
declaration O
on O

And O
diplomats O
noted O
that O
Putin O
appeared O
uncomfortable O
at O
being O
so O
closely O
associated O
with O
the O
anti-Washington B-LOC
stance O
of O
Schroeder O

Chirac O

his O
developing O

although O

It O
remains O
to O

how O
successful O
Putin O

be O
in O
the O

the O
fervent O

A O

very O
close O

and O
if O
I O
sound O
a O
little O

it's O

what O

when O

Of O

you O

on O
an O
adrenaline O
high O

racing O

you O
know O
that O
you O
're O
traveling O
toward O
the O
jaws O
of O
what O
could O
be O
a O
major O
military O
battle O

You O
have O
to O
realize O
, O
they O
've O
been O
riding O
along O

bouncing O
along O
in O
these O
tanks O
for O
probably O
six O
or O
more O
hours O
now O

And O
if O
you O
ride O
inside O
that O

it O
is O

in O
the O

they O

The O
hardest O

We O

The O
extraordinary O
sandstorms O

the O
bitter O

The O
most O
uncomfortable O

sandbags O
under O
your O
feet O

your O

That O
's O
excruciatingly O
uncomfortable O

not O
something O
that O
you O
would O
wish O
on O
anybody O
but O
a O
contortionist O

Let O
me O
give O
you O
an O
example O
of O
what O
the O
dust O
like O

very O
close O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
no O
more O
than O
40 O
yards O
away O
, O
but O
the O
dust O
and O
sand O
are O
blowing O
so O
badly O
you O
're O
getting O
these O
vague O
images O

It O
's O
like O
being O
in O
a O
blizzard O
, O
except O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
sand O
doesn't O
melt O
as O
the O

What O
we O
eat O
is O
what O
the O
Army B-ORG
calls O
MREs O

meals O

And O
I O
must O
say O

they O
're O
pretty O

good O

And O
of O

, O
everybody O
fights O
for O
the O

The O

the O
