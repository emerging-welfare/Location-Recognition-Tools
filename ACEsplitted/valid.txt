divorce O
is O
really O
stupid O
... O

I O
think O
divorce O
is O
really O
stupid O
. O

It O
'll O
take O
me O
awhile O
to O
get O
to O
thought O
stream O
that O
got O
me O
to O
that O
thought O
today O
. O

First O
off O
, O
I O
'm O
remarried O
, O
divorced O
3 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
love O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
the O
kids O
get O
along O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
my O
exwife O
. O

But O
there O
was O
a O
time O
when O
I O
did O
like O
her O
; O
in O
fact O
I O
loved O
her O
very O
much O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
numerous O
flaws O
, O
chief O
among O
those O
flaws O
is O
that O
she O
's O
a O
narcicists O
. O

But O
we O
all O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
personality O
problems O
... O
. O
My O
wife O
belongs O
to O
a O
support O
group O
, O
and O
just O
for O
fun O
, O
they O
all O
googled O
their O
hubbies O
ex O
's O
. O

Somehow O
, O
this O
lead O
me O
to O
googling O
my O
ex O
's O
boyfriend O
, O
call O
him O
B O
. O

And O
there O
he O
was O
, O
talking O
about O
plans O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
kids O
. O

Wow O
. O

To O
me O
, O
B O
was O
just O
this O
one O
dimensional O
guy O
that O
was O
being O
dragged O
along O
by O
my O
exwife O
. O

Now O
, O
he O
turns O
out O
to O
have O
a O
3 O
dimensional O
life O
too O
. O

I O
guess O
we O
all O
do O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
him O
out O
for O
a O
beer O
sometime O
. O

It O
would O
be O
fun O
. O

I O
wonder O
what O
happenned O
to O
B O
's O
son O
? O

My O
kids O
never O
mentioned O
B O
having O
a O
son O
. O

B O
's O
son O
is O
apparently O
16 O
years O
old O
, O
same O
age O
as O
my O
daughter O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
B O
had O
a O
huge O
messy O
divorce O
, O
and O
his O
ex O
took O
the O
kid O
out O
of O
state O
. O

My O
ex O
threatened O
that O
. O

Ouch O
. O

Divorce O
really O
sucks O
. O

I O
have O
my O
kids O
almost O
50/50 O
these O
days O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
huge O
messy O
post O
divorce O
compromise O
that O
took O
a O
year O
to O
complete O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
B O
had O
to O
go O
through O
some O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
shit O
? O

Perhaps O
my O
exwife O
has O
more O
sympathy O
for O
what O
its O
like O
to O
be O
a O
guy O
on O
the O
receiving O
end O
of O
a O
divorce O
now O
? O

Ok O
, O
keep O
googling O
. O

Oh O
my O
, O
the O
plot O
thickens O
. O

I O
found O
B O
's O
exwife O
. O

Very O
articulate O
writer O
. O

This O
is O
really O
humorous O
. O

She O
wrote O
an O
article O
about O
a O
divorce O
support O
group O
, O
ending O
it O
with O
something O
about O
Mrs. O
B O
being O
happily O
married O
but O
she O
's O
impressed O
by O
the O
divorce O
support O
group O
. O

And O
that O
was O
only O
4 O
years O
ago O
! O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
B O
had O
a O
real O
life O
too O
. O

They O
shared O
dreams O
together O
, O
raised O
a O
kid O
, O
and O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
together O
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
even O
more O
curious O
about O
the O
B O
's O
kid O
. O

She O
still O
lives O
in O
town O
here O
. O

Maybe O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
terrible O
tragedy O
? O
? O
? O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
ask O
about O
B O
's O
kid O
when O
my O
own O
kids O
switch O
off O
next O
week O
. O

Sometimes O
we O
want O
to O
see O
marriage O
one O
dimensionally O
. O

Either O
its O
bad O
or O
good O
. O

That O
's O
total O
bullshit O
. O

I O
know O
my O
first O
marriage O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
adventures O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
friendship O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
love O
. O

Oh O
, O
yeah O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
perfect O
. O

My O
exwife O
is O
a O
total O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
much O
of O
the O
time O
, O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
let O
her O
do O
what O
she O
wanted O
, O
sometimes O
I O
could O
n't O
. O

But O
, O
even O
to O
the O
end O
, O
we O
loved O
each O
other O
. O

And O
now O
, O
I O
see O
the O
lost O
family O
ties O
. O

She O
's O
lost O
my O
family O
, O
I O
'm O
slowly O
drifting O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
her O
family O
. O

We O
both O
build O
new O
lives O
. O

New O
lives O
. O

But O
you O
know O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
kids O
are O
shared O
, O
you O
can't O
total O
get O
this O
exspouse O
out O
of O
your O
mental O
psyche O
. O

They O
say O
it O
takes O
one O
year O
for O
every O
two O
that O
you O
were O
married O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
life O
goes O
on O
. O

My O
wife O
's O
name O
is O
M. O
We O
're O
going O
to O
a O
bed O
and O
breakfast O
this O
weekend O
, O
to O
get O
away O
, O
relax O
. O

M O
and O
I O
are O
slowly O
building O
a O
history O
of O
our O
own O
together O
. O

We O
share O
adventures O
together O
, O
we O
share O
adventure O
with O
my O
kids O
, O
and O
with O
our O
dogs O
. O

And O
, O
I O
take O
lots O
of O
pictures O
. O

I O
really O
have O
n't O
changed O
very O
much O
from O
who O
I O
was O
before O
. O

Although O
, O
the O
dog O
thing O
is O
really O
post O
divorce O
. O

Lots O
and O
lots O
of O
pictures O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
look O
at O
the O
old O
photos O
, O
before O
divorce O
. O

We O
smiled O
together O
, O
laughed O
, O
hugged O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
digital O
camera O
users O
, O
and O
I O
have O
too O
many O
photos O
from O
my O
first O
marriage O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
racing O
to O
create O
enough O
photos O
of O
my O
new O
life O
to O
outweigh O
the O
long O
history O
of O
my O
first O
life O
. O

That O
's O
going O
to O
take O
awhile O
... O
Luckily O
, O
we O
flawed O
human O
beings O
live O
long O
lives O
, O
and O
digital O
cameras O
take O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
pictures O
! O

If O
my O
exwife O
does O
n't O
dump O
B O
, O
maybe O
they O
'll O
wind O
up O
staying O
together O
, O
maybe O
even O
getting O
married O
. O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
nice O
. O

And O
they O
too O
will O
begin O
the O
process O
of O
rebuilding O
their O
`` O
together O
'' O
lives O
. O

I'm O
assuming O
there O
is O
some O
humanity O
beneath O
my O
exwife O
's O
narcicistic O
shell O
, O
but O
I O
do O
believe O
there O
is O
. O

B O
seems O
like O
a O
decent O
enough O
person O
too O
. O

So O
, O
B O
and O
my O
ex O
will O
be O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
that O
I O
'm O
doing O
. O

Rebuilding O
their O
lives O
. O

Anyway O
, O
all O
of O
this O
gets O
me O
back O
to O
my O
original O
point O
. O

Divorce O
seems O
really O
really O
stupid O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
that O
beneath O
it O
all O
, O
we O
all O
want O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Love O
, O
companionship O
, O
and O
a O
partner O
for O
our O
life's O
journies O
. O

None O
of O
this O
makes O
total O
sense O
to O
me O
. O

But O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
'd O
ramble O

Re O
: O
divorce O

really O
stupid O
... O

Your O
post O
made O
me O
horribly O
sad O
. O

My O
ex O
has O
that O
nice O
new O
life O
with O
the O
child-bride O
and O
the O
2 O
cats O
and O
2 O
dogs O
and O
new O
house O
and O
my O
son O
primarily O
lives O
with O
them O
even O
though O
he O
ends O
up O
being O
at O
my O
place O
1/2 O
the O
time O
in O
a O
2-week O
period O
. O

-- O
I O
live O
in O
a O
961 O
sq O
. O

ft. O
apartment O
. O

My O
ex O
has O
most O
all O
of O
the O
photos O
as O
our O
son O
lives O
there O
and O
it O
's O
his O
history O
. O

I O
did O
get O
a O
good O
bunch O
of O
the O
wedding O
photos O
, O
but O
my O
ex O
refused O
to O
give O
them O
all O
to O
me O
saying O
it O
was O
`` O
his O
life O
too O
'' O
even O
though O
I O
really O
resent O
them O
being O
under O
the O
same O
roof O
with O
his O
child-bride O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
they O
are O
taking O
lots O
of O
pictures O
of O
their O
trips/vacations/whatever O
( O
at O
least O
2 O
that O
I O
know O
of O
) O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
own O
a O
camera O
. O

His O
new O
inlaws O
are O
all O
former O
family O
friends O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
anymore O
for O
obvious O
reasons O
. O

His O
family O
( O
brother O
, O
sister O
, O
stepmother O
) O
conveniently O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
for O
almost O
20 O
years O
I O
was O
a O
member O
of O
their O
family O
. O

There O
was O
no O
gradual O
`` O
drifting O
of O
out O
touch O
'' O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
all O
live O
in O
the O
same O
city O
and O
my O
ex O
BIL O
and O
I O
even O
work O
within O
blocks O
of O
each O
other O
. O

My O
family O
thinks O
my O
ex O
is O
pond O
scum O
but O
because O
my O
parents O
are O
still O
members O
at O
the O
same O
church O
, O
they O
have O
to O
see O
my O
ex O
and O
his O
new O
wife O
every O
week O
. O

My O
mother O
took O
his O
remarriage O
harder O
than O
I O
did O
, O
I O
think O
, O
because O
of O
that O
. O

Divorce O
*is* O
really O
stupid O
. O

Duh-uh O
. O

Especially O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
still O
have O
so O
many O
years O
( O
if O
one O
year O
for O
every O
2 O
married O
, O
then O
I've O
still O
got O
another O
7 O
or O
so O
) O
to O
go O
to O
get O
our O
heads O
screwed O
back O
on O
and O
find O
some O
sort O
of O
life O
that O
rivals O
what O
we O
had O
or O
what O
our O
ex O
has O
or O
what O
you O
and O
your O
ex O
have O
. O

So O
far O
, O
this O
is O
not O
it O

I O
said O

... O
.. O
'' O
shit O

going O

get O
ugly O

And O
although O
I O

do O
this O

may O
have O
to O
flex O
our O

I O
think O
we O
are O
screwed O
with O
N B-LOC

Korea B-LOC

but O
Syria B-LOC
and O
Iran B-LOC
are O
really O

Syria B-LOC

Re O

War O

Iran O
please O
. O

this O
is O
a O
cop-out O
response O
. O

the O
reason O
we O
are O
so O
worried O
is O
because O
we O
are O
on O
a O
higher O
level O
than O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
world O
because O
we O
have O
nucler O
weapons O
. O

if O
countries O
we O
do O
n't O
like O
start O
developing O
nuclear O
weapons-grade O
material O
it O
makes O
us O
nervous O
. O

although O
so O
far O
, O
iran B-LOC
has O
shown O
that O
they O
are O
*not* O
producing O
weapons-grade O
material O
and O
are O
in O
fact O
using O
their O
nuclear O
power O
for O
just O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
IAEA B-ORG
. O

but O
when O
you O
have O
a O
sitting O
president O
who O
has O
an O
infatuation O
with O
provoking O
other O
countries O
into O
a O
war O
, O
you O
can O
bet O
that O
he O
will O
try O
everything O
he O
can O
to O
try O
to O
prove O
his O
case O
against O
iran B-LOC
. O

maybe O
because O
oil O
is O
a O
much O
bigger O
polluting O
source O
of O
energy O
than O
nuclear O
? O

or O
maybe O
because O
it O
's O
more O
cost O
effective O
for O
them O
to O
use O
nuclear O
than O
any O
other O
method O
? O

why O
should O
they O
run O
their O
energy O
supply O
off O
of O
one O
of O
their O
backbone O
industries O
when O
oil O
is O
worth O
more O
to O
them O
on O
the O
open O
market O
? O

-- O
'' O
I O
am O
not O
allowed O
to O
ever O
come O
up O
with O
a O

And O
I O

it O

not O
a O
question O

whether O
i O
believe O

telling O
the O
truth O

the O
question O
was O
asked O
: O
why O
is O
the O

scared O
of O

and O
your O
response O
was O
'' O
because O
they O

. O

this O
is O
a O
cop-out O
because O
you O
're O
not O
really O
proving O
anything O
, O
you O
're O
just O
making O
accusations O
without O
proof O
. O

ok O
, O
they O
made O
a O
very O
very O
small O
amount O

a O

that O
could O
maybe O
be O
used O
in O
a O

if O
they O
had O
more O
of O
it O
possibly O

but O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
iran B-LOC
is O
cooperating O
with O
most O
of O
the O
international O
community O
on O
this O

whether O
your O

this O
was O
about O
nuclear O
proliferation O

not O
iraq B-LOC

i O
think O
that O
if O
they O
have O
proof O

iran B-LOC

assistance O

iraqi B-LOC

that O
it O
can O

, O
Mischie O

who O

Mischie O

Maybe O

did O
vote O
. O

Ivan O
Mhm O
. O

John O
And O
, O
um O
, O
elections O
wore O
me O
down O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
tired O
of O
all O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
all O
the O
commercials O
and O
all O
the O
hype O
and O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
it O
we O
have O
lunch O
at O
work O
and O
-- O
the O
whole O
lunch O
time O
all O
you O
do O
is O
see O
commercials O
about O
the O
-- O
politicians O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
um O
, O
Ivan O
Mhm O
. O

John O
yeah O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
I O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
voted O
. O

John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
Um O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
-- O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
get O
-- O
regardless O
of O
what O
year O
it O
is O
or O
who O
the O
candidates O
are O
I O
get O
tired O
of O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

It O
-- O
basically O
all O
of O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O
all O
the O
time O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
they O
, O
uh O
, O
tell O
you O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
then O
they O
turn O
around O
and O
-- O
do O
something O
different O
all O
the O
time O
anyway O
, O
so O
it O
's O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
wor- O
-- O
worth O
voting O
, O
but O
-- O
sometimes O
I O
wonder O
. O

John O

I'd- O
I O
've O
never O

as O
what O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
various O
candidates O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
we O
-- O
said O
what O
we O
said O
about O
Bush O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
Kerry O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
it O
's O
just O
that O
-- O
-coast O
, O
uh O
, O
kind O
of O
persona O
or O
image O
, O
-t O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
-- O
do O
n't O
care O
for O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
. O

John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
From O

-- O
-candidate O
. O

John O
Right O
. O

Ivan O
And O
, O
uh O
, O
Cheney O
-- O
which O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
out O
your O
way O
, O
uh O
, O
Wyoming B-LOC
. O

John O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ivan O
Uh O
, O
uh O
, O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
a O
non-descript O
person O
, O
as O
far O
as O
, O
like O
I O
I'm O
sure O
he O
's O
he O
's O
probably O
a O
nice O
guy O
, O
and O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
at O
a O
party O
probably O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
, O
you O
know O
, O
just O
from O
-- O
what O
you O
see O
of O
him O
, O
he O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
-- O
kind O
of O
like O
an O
old O
grandpa O
, O
you O
know O
. O

John O
Yeah O
, O
he O
's O
real O
grouchy O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
he O
just O
John O
In O
those O
debates O
he O
was O
like O
a O
pitbull O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

John O
You O
know O
, O
he O
would O
c- O
him O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O

he O
he O
kind O
of O
picked O
apart O
Edwards O
Ivan O
Mhm O
. O

John O

, O
um O
, O
but O
then O
-- O
Edwards O
fought O
back O
kind O
of O
-- O
you O
know O
and O
then O
all O
the O
stuff O
you O
hear O
about O
Edwards O

, O
about O
the O
, O
uh O
, O
how O

suing O
insurance O
companies O
and O
, O
um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there- O
there O
's O
-- O
bad O
stuff O
you O
hear O
about O
both O
of O
them O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
obviously O
they O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
Ivan O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

John O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
like O

And O
, O
I O
guess O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
like O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
uh O
, O
Kerry O
was O
, O
like O
, O
changing O
his O
story O
all O
the O
time O
, O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
I- O
-- O
I O
believe O

but O
, O
uh O

, O
Ivan O

kind O
of O
a O
cut O

dry O
kind O
of O
a O
guy O
. O

Ivan O
Yeah O
. O

John O

opinion O
I O
'd O
rather O

straight O
up O
and O
not O
Ivan O
Yeah O
. O

John O
try O
to O
beat O
around O
the O
bush O
to O

get O
my O
vote O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Ivan O

a O
certain O
degree O
they O

I O
guess O
try O
to O
play O

Illinois B-LOC

Derek O

Marco O
Derek O

Derek O

nice O
to O

you O

Derek O

, O
you O
too O
. O

Marco O
Um O
Derek O
How O
's O
it O
going O
? O

Marco O
Good O
, O
good O
. O

So O
, O
uh O
the O
election O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
, O
um O
-- O
let O
's O
see O
, O
overall O
I O
felt O
-- O
ju- O
just O
give O
you O
a O
brief O
-- O
summary O
, O
I O
felt O
-- O
that O
-- O
John O
Kerry O
and O
Edwards O
were O
were O
pretty O
strong O
candidates O
and O
-- O
uh O
-- O
mm O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
just O
in O
terms O
of O
policy O
I O
did O
n't O
-- O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
uh O
, O
find O
-- O
that O
as O
compelling O
as O
just O
-- O
the O
personality O
of O
-- O
the O
different O
candidates O
. O

Derek O
Yeah O
. O

Marco O
felt O
like O
I O
could O
trust O
Kerry O
-- O
uh O
, O
little O
bit O
more O
even O
though O
he O
was O
much O
more O
of O
a O
politician O
than O
Bush O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
, O
he O
was O
-- O
kind O
of O
a O
smooth O
talker O
and O
Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Um O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seems O
like O
a O
politician O
, O
they O
way O
he O
presented O
Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
his O
you O
know O
his O
his O
um O
argument O
. O

But O
-- O
uh O
-- O
strangely O
I O
felt O
like O
that O
what O
, O
that O
was O
-- O
one O
of O
-- O
one O
of O
his O
good O
qualities O
because O
I O
didn't O
feel O
Bush O
was O
politician O
enough O
. O

That O
um O
-- O
one O
of O
the O
-- O
issues O
that O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
was O
just O
-- O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
-- O
on O
the O
international O
stage O
Derek O
Sure O
. O

Marco O
and O
I O
just O
-- O
uh O
-- O
I O
uh O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
Bush O
is O
-- O
the O
way O
he O
presents O
um O
-- O
the O
~US B-LOC
position O
-- O
uh O
-- O
seemed O
a O
little O
-- O
abrasive O
to O
me O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
And O
I O
-- O
felt O
like O
, O
hm O
-- O
if O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
, O
um O
-- O
make O
-- O
um O
-- O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
safer O
and O
more O
stable O
-- O
conflict O
in O
the O
world O
more O
stable O
then O
we O
probably O
need O
somebody O
-- O
who O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
-- O
of O
a O
politician O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
-- O
the O
, O
they O
care O
about O
diplomacy O
and O
-- O
uh O
, O
even O
though O
we O
may O
not O
-- O
give O
in O
to O
-- O
the O
will O
of O
the O
other O
nations O
present O
it O
in O
a O
nicer O
way O
. O

Derek O
Mhm O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
it O
seems O
( O
( O
I O
make O
) O
) O
kind O
of O
simplistic O
, O
but O
-- O
that O
was O
-- O
an O
important O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

Uh O
Derek O
Yeah O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
Um O
-- O
I O
was O
a O
little O
different O
. O

I O
I O
I O
agree O
with O
everything O
you O
said O
. O

I O
just O
, O
um O
-- O
I O
come O
from O
a O
little O
different O
background O
as O
far O
as O
being O
-- O
I O
was O
never O
into O
politics O
and O
now O
I O
I O
actually O
have O
gotten O
into O
God O
much O
more O
and O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
searching O
spirituality O
out O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
Generally O
people O
like O
that O
are O
conservative O
, O
you O
know O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
uh O
, O
with O
their O
views O
because O
of O
different O
things O
like O
abortion O
and O
, O
and O
, O
uh O
, O
pro-life O
and O
-- O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
so O
I O
came O
form O
that O
background O
Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
eh O
, O
but O
that O
was O
just O
an O
added O
bonus O
for O
me O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
-- O
I O
too O
was O
obviously O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
concerned O
about O
the O
welfare O
of O
our O
security O
-- O
and O
I O
felt O
personally O
that O
if O
-- O
Kerry O
was O
in O
office O
we O
'd O
kind O
of O
be O
, O
uh O
-- O
up O
a O
creek O
without O
a O
paddle O
because O
I O
think O
-- O
he O
is O
so O
laid O
back O
-- O
um O
, O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
Bush O
that O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
game O
, O
where O
we O
're O
at O
-- O
we O
're O
in O
this O
thing O
full O
full O
-- O
steam O
ahead O
Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
and O
for O
a O
transition O
to O
occur O
at O
this O
point O
-- O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
laid O
back O
-- O
and O
not O
as O
aggressive O
as O
him O
I O
think O
would O
actually O
endanger O
the O
~US B-LOC
even O
more O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
I O
think O
that O
the O
international O
, O
uh O
uh O
, O
leaders O
would O
look O
at O
Kerry O
and O
know O
, O
they O
're O
very O
smart O
, O
I O
mean O
they O
're O
-- O
they O
're O
on O
top O
of O
these O
things O
, O
they O
know O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
would O
, O
it O
just O
would O
have O
opened O
a O
gateway O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
I O
feel O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
that O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
may O
have O
actually O
put O
us O
in O
more O
danger O
. O

At O
least O
Bush O
has O
-- O
pulled O
out O
the O
gun O
, O
you O
know O
, O
stick O
to O
them O
, O
and O
um O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
that O
's O
where O
I O
was O
coming O
from O
on O
that O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
And O
then O
when O
I O
Marco O
( O
( O
Do O
you O
think O
) O
) O
Derek O
I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
when O
I O
heard O
the O
stuff O
about O
Kerry O
back O
in O
the O
-- O
the O
the O
, O
apparently O
the O
scandals O
he O
's O
pulled O
as O
far O
as O
the O
uh O
, O
medals O
when O
he O
served O
time O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
You O
know O
, O
uh O
-- O
I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
radio O
and O
spoke O
with O
, O
you O
know O
, O
heard O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
, O
uh O
-- O
veterans O
-- O
and O
they O
said O
it O
was O
physically O
, O
uh O
, O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
achieve O
what O
he O
said O
he O
did O
. O

Marco O
Uh O
huh O
. O

Uh O
huh O
. O

Derek O
And O
all O
the O
meetings O
he O
's O
missing O
, O
and O
just O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
think O
it's O
more O
of O
a O
status O
quo O
for O
him O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
I O
think O
he O
's O
more O
, O
he O
got O
so O
much O
money O
that O
I O
think O
he O
was O
just O
concerned O
with O
attaining O
this O
position O
and O
a O
title O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Derek O
you O
know O
( O
( O
flag O
) O
) O
for O
him O
, O
so O
Marco O
Do O
you O
think O
, O
um O
-- O
the O
-- O
when O
the O
Republicans O
are O
campaigning O
-- O
they O
were O
saying O
that O
well O
, O
another O
attack O
on O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

is O
-- O
imminent O
, O
that O
it O
probably O
-- O
probably O
going O
to O
happen O
-- O
and O
-- O
um O
-- O
and O
-- O
they O
even O
went O
so O
far O
to O
say O
that O
if O
-- O
it O
's O
really O
difficult O
to O
prevent O
something O
like O
this O
and O
of O
course O
they O
're O
doing O
the O
best O
they O
can O
and O
-- O
I O
think O
Kerry O
would O
do O
the O
best O
he O
could O
. O

But O
do O
you O
think O
, O
um O
-- O
that O
-- O
and O
this O
is O
n't O
quite O
a O
political O
issue O
, O
but O
do O
you O
think O
that O
-- O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
another O
attack O
on O
the O
~US B-LOC
? O

Uh O
like O
in O
the O
next O
five O
years O
? O

Something O
big O
like O
-- O
the O
world O
( O
( O
) O
) O
Derek O
I O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
your O
beliefs O
are O
, O
as O
far O
as O
, O
uh O
-- O
biblically O
or O
spiritually O
or O
whatever O
, O
but O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
's O
inevitable O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we're O
going O
down O
, O
you O
know O
? O

And O
, O
yeah O
, O
and O
this O
is O
, O
all O
these O
things O
have O
been O
written O
about O
actually O
. O

Marco O
Really O
? O

Derek O
Um O
-- O
The O
tw- O
the O
uh O
-- O
what O
is O
it O
, O
the O
towers O
, O
uh O
-- O
that O
was O
actually O
uh O
there O
's O
references O
to O
that O
in O
the O

about O
the O
uh O
topic O
of O
discussion O
this O
evening O
? O

Sherri O
I O
've O
been O
sort O
of O
surprised O
. O

Eh O
uh O
I O
-- O
I O
heard O
uh O
that O
Colin O
Powell O
wanted O
um O
-- O
to O
resign O
last O
year O
and O
they O
talked O
him O
out O
of O
it O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
Or O
something O
like O
that O
and O
uh O
so O
-- O
I O
was O
still O
surprised O
this O
year O
when O
Ron O
Oh O
thi- O
you O
were O
surprised O
that O
he O
yo- O
that O
he O
decided O
to O
step O
down O
. O

Sherri O
yeah O
I O
I O
I O
still O
was O
uh O
-- O
kind O
of O
surprised O
. O

Ron O
Oh O
, O
huh O
, O
how O
interesting O
. O

Sherri O
eh O
-- O
And O
uh O
-- O
and O
then O
uh O
with O
Condoleezza O
Rice O
. O

They O
're O
appointing O
her O
ta- O
to O
a O
new O
position O
, O
and O
I O
was O
surprised O
about O
Ashcroft O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
I O
was O
n't O
like O
it O
and O
then O
Tom O
Ridge O
yesterday O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
uh O
that O
one O
I O
think O
one O
probably O
was O
the O
one O
that O
most O
surprised O
me O
. O

I O
had O
n't O
I O
had O
n't O
really O
thought O
about O
it O
. O

I O
-- O
Colin O
Powell O
did O
n't O
surprise O
me O
. O

Ashcroft O
surprised O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
um O
but O
um O
I O
sort O
of O
started O
to O
think O
he O
might O
step O
down O
because O
evidently O
he O
was O
being O
he O
was O
considered O
somewhat O
of O
a O
lightning O
rod O
for O
um O
you O
know O
some O
of O
his O
more O
controversial O
stands O
and O
stuff O
so O
. O

Sherri O
Uh-huh O
. O

Ron O
But O
and O
and O
so O
have O
you O
been O
following O
the O
uh O
the O
proposed O
nominees O
? O

I O
mean O
do O
you O
think O
Sherri O
Kellogg B-ORG
, O
the O
Kellogg B-ORG
guy O
. O

Ron O
Oh O
yeah O
, O
that O
's O
right O
. O

Where O
's O
he O
going O
to O
Commerce B-ORG
? O

Is O
that O
where O
he O
's O
headed O
? O

Sherri O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
it O
, O
huh O
? O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
him O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
anything O
about O
him O
? O

Sherri O
Mm O
. O

Well O
, O
all O
I O
know O
is O
that O
that O
's O
like O
a O
real O
prestigious O
uh O
position O
, O
you O
know O
to O
be O
the O
what O
the O
~CEO O
of O
Kellogg B-ORG
? O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
yeah O
. O

I O
guess O
it O
sort O
of O
concerns O
me O
that O
uh O
you O
know O
we're O
looking O
at O
yet O
uh O
another O
corporate O
head O
coming O
into O
the O
government O
. O

I O
Sherri O
Mm O
. O

Ye- O
ye- O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
like O
a O
-- O
uh O
it O
's O
a O
re- O
-- O
I O
think O
we O
have O
a O
real O
problem O
. O

That O
is O
uh O
-- O
you O
know O
almost O
like O
a O
big O
beast O
you O
know O
that O
's O
right O
there O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
even O
identify O
it O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
way O
way O
way O
more O
than O
we O
realize O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
, O
I O
I O
think O
you O
're O
probably O
right O
and O
I O
think O
it O
-- O
maybe O
even O
particularly O
true O
under O
this O
President O
, O
although O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it's O
just O
limited O
to O
him O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
common O
problem O
in O
the O
~US B-LOC
. O

Sherri O
I O
f- O
-- O
I O
uh O
I O
think O
i- O
i- O
it O
's O
uh O
more O
evident O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
Sherri O
You O
know O
, O
really O
um O
-- O
tremen- O
tremendously O
a O
ruling O
and O
reigning O
. O

Ron O
Did O
you O
um O
Sherri O
I O
think O
it O
it O
's O
a O
global O
uh O
has O
a O
global O
effect O
. O

Ron O
Yeah O
. O

Sherri O
I O
think O
that O
's O
why O
Al-Qaeda B-ORG
-- O
took O
down O
the O
the O
uh O
twin O
towers O
. O

Eh O
w- O
they O
were O
making O
a O
a O
statement O
. O

Uh O
I O
think O
something O
like O
that O
possibly O
, O
that O
it O
had O
to O
do O
with O
corporate O
America O
. O

Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
you O
mean O
about O
the O
corporate O
thing O
? O

Sherri O
Hm O
? O

Ron O
Uh O
you O
mean O
because O
of O
its O
-- O
what O
it O
represented O
around O
corporate O
America O
or O
something O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
you O
think O
. O

Sherri O
I O
think O
what O
corporate O
America O
represents O
-- O
you O
know O
the O
the O
financial O
scheme O
of O
it O
all O
, O
the O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
the O
it O
just O
how O
it O
eff- O
effects O
the O
globe O
, O
Ron O
Mhm O
. O

Sherri O
and O
how O
eh O
it O
effects O
third O
world O
countries O
and O
you O
know O
just O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

It O
's O
just O
Ron O
Mhm O
, O
mhm O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
it O
's O
a O
you O
know O
like O
a O
a O
a O
wealthy O
despotism O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O

Ron O
So O
any O
thoughts O
on O
who O
you O
uh O
you O
would O
name O
? O

Sherri O
( O
( O
) O
) O
-- O
You O
know O
who O
I O
would O
name O
? O

I O
know O
this O
is O
really O
wild O
. O

Ron O
Do O
you O
suppose O
? O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
But O
uh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
you O
'll O
probably O
really O
laugh O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
I O
I O
I O
always O
thought O
that O
-- O
Ralph O
Nader O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
a O
character O
Ron O
Oh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
but O
what O
I O
really O
I O
mean O
I O
really O
listened O
to O
what O
he O
said O
when O
he O
was O
being O
interviewed O
Ron O
Mhm O
. O

Sherri O
and O
in O
just O
a O
few O
words O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
mince O
any O
meat O
or O
anything O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
he O
said O
so O
much O
that O
was O
so O
Ron O
Uh-huh O
. O

Sherri O
like O
-- O
like O
a O
clarion O
call O
it O
rang O
so O
clear O
. O

You O
could O
hear O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
and O
it O
was O
really O
making O
sense O
, O
and O
I O
think O
he O
's O
an O
expert O
Ron O
So O
who O
would O
y- O
what O
would O
you O
appoint O
him O
to O
? O

Sherri O
on O
Ron O
Any O
particular O
position O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Sherri O
eh O
-- O
there O
's O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
economy O
y- O
you O
know O
for O
the O
with O
the O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Ron O
Yeah O
. O

Sherri O
just O
uh O
-- O
like O
a O
an O
equa- O
e- O
economic O
equilibrium O
or O
something O
. O

Ron O
He O
might O
be O
be O
good O
at O
-- O
yeah O
, O
he O
might O
be O
good O
at O
commerce O
instead O
of O
that O
Kellogg B-ORG

senators O

what O

i O

some O

intelligence O

crucial O

now O

since O
there O

Consumers O

they O

That O
's O
changed O
in O
the O
last O
twenty O
years O

as O
increasing O
social O
mobility O
and O
a O
burst O

finally O
made O
China B-LOC

they O

that O
they O
've O
beaten O

If O
only O
I O
'd O
figured O
this O
out O

For O

-- O
you O

me O
a O
second O
, O
but O
I O

. O

A O
Yeah O
. O

I O
always O
think O
about O
that O
like O
-- O
or O
a O
lot O
of O
I O
think O
college O
students O
think O
about O
that O
like O
with O
some O
office O
jobs O
, O
you O
know O
? O

B O
Yeah O
. O

It O
's O
uh O
A O
So O
. O

It O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
, O
that O
's O
the O
job O
that O
they O
're O
t- O
everyone's O
trying O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
. O

B O
Yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
're O
quite O
-- O
They O
they O
've O
gotten O
better O
. O

I O
know O
the O
bigger O
companies O
have O
tried O
to O
-- O
stay O
away O
from O
that O
, O
cause O
uh O
-- O
The O
the O
that O
does O
wear O
you O
out O
. O

I O
remember O
Bank B-ORG
of O
America B-ORG
was O
-- O
kind O
of O
like O
that O
in O
the O
department O
I O
used O
to O
work O
in O
, O
years O
and O
years O

. O

A O
Uh-huh O

boring O

It O
it O
drained O
the O

you O
whenever O

work O
. O

It O
just O
-- O
sucked O
. O

A O
Yeah O

B O
But O
they O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
more O
entertaining O

going O
for O
the O
uh O

employee O
satisfaction O
. O

Finally O

And O
they O
were O
all O

finally O
got O
there O

But O
we O

it O

They O
did O
n't O
like O
give O
everybody O

? O

Ed O
Good O
. O

James O
Well O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O

Ed O
I O
think O
I O
was O
on O
this O
one O
yesterday O
, O
same O
subject O
. O

James O
I O
, O
I O
believe O
I O
've O
talked O
about O
this O
subject O
once O
before O
too O
. O

Ed O
Uh O
, O
Well O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O
my O
past O
views O
were O
, O
uh O
-- O
illness-wise O
, O
ah O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
it O
helped O
him O
, O
being O
in O
the O
compound O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
But O
, O
You O
're O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
're O
never O
going O
to O
know O
if O
there O
was O
any O
, O
ah O
, O
clandestine-type O
operation O
that O
-- O
Aided O
his O
, O
ah O
-- O
ah O
, O
illness O
. O

James O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
I O
think O
that O
they O
, O
ah O
, O
( O
( O
) O
) O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
ever O
going O
to O
find O
out O
if O
there O
was O
any O
direct O
James O
Right O
. O

Ed O
tampering O
James O
Right O
. O

Ed O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
you O
know O
, O
from O
just O
the O
generic O
point O
, O
or O
general O
point O
of O
view O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
his O
illness O
once O
he O
got O
-- O
sick O
-- O
being O
in O
the O
compound O
, O
closed O
in O
like O
that O
with O
the O
Arabs O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
And O
that O
James O
I O
do O
n't O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
think O
there O
was O
something O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
malicious O
done O
, O
because O
, O
you O
know O
, O
looking O
back O
-- O
he O
's O
been O
had O
this O
shaking O
thing O
going O
on O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

And O
I O
agree O
that O
the O
surroundings O
could O
n't O
have O
helped O
. O

Ed O
Right O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
it O
, O
it O
could O
've O
only O
exacerbated O
, O
uh O
, O
his O
situation O
. O

Because O
for O
-- O
for O
a O
good O
little O
while O
now O
I O
've O
noticed O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
his O
lips O
would O
tremble O
, O
and O
Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
um O
, O
uh O
, O
almost O
like O
he O
had O
, O
uh O
, O
what O
is O
that O
, O
Parkinson O
's O
? O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Uh O
, O
something O
like O
that O
, O
but O
, O
uh O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
exact O
conditions O
were O
-- O
in O
that O
compound O
, O
but O
they O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
, O
ah O
, O
conducive O
to O
someone O
of O
his O
age O
-- O
and O
of O
his O
health O
-- O
and O
as O
far O
as O
, O
as O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
sending O
a O
senior O
~US B-LOC
official O
, O
I O
think O
they O
should O
've O
sent O
someone O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
senior O
that O
person O
had O
to O
be O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
could O
've O
been O
a O
gesture O
Ed O
Well O
they O
did O
-- O
they O
did O
send O
somebody O
, O
I O
thought O
. O

Did O
n't O
they O
go O
with O
a O
senior O
official O
, O
I O
had O
James O
to O
Ed O
did O
n't O
think O
they O
were O
going O
to O
ask O
this O
question O
, O
but O
I O
James O
Oh O
y- O
yeah O
, O
you O
're O
right O
, O
they O
did O
send O
someone O
. O

Ed O
but O
it O
was O
n't O
-- O
like O
, O
ah O
, O
was O
n't O
Bush O
, O
I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
send O
him O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
want O
to O
have O
him O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
right O
now O
. O

James O
Right O
. O

No O
. O

No O
. O

No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Ed O
Regardless O
of O
what O
you O
think O
about O
him O
, O
he O
's O
, O
ah O
James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
should O
have O
went O
-- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I O
don't O
think O
any O
senior O
official O
should O
've O
went O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
-- O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
should O
have O
went O
. O

Uh O
, O
whoever O
they O
sent O
was O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
was O
good O
enough O
, O
just O
to O
show O
-- O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
-- O
that O
, O
uh O
you O
know O
, O
America B-LOC
does O
care O
somewhat O
-- O
that O
you O
've O
lost O
your O
leader O
. O

But O
, O
uh O
, O
no O
, O
it O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
it O
would O
've O
been O
a O
wro- O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
I O
think O
sending O
Bush O
would O
have O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

You O
know O
. O

Uh O
, O
because O
he O
's O
not O
liked O
that O
much O
by O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
people O
. O

So O
I O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
sending O
him O
would O
've O
been O
-- O
would O
've O
been O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

Ed O
No O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

James O
Yeah O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
've O
added O
anything O
to O
-- O
to O
the O
situation O
. O

and O
possibly O
could O
've O
made O
it O
worse O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
. O

James O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
As O
to O
-- O
his O
burial O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
ah O
, O
Not O
anymore O
, O
these O
are O
all O
, O
uh O
like O
these O
are O
all O
political O
responses O
James O
Huh O
. O

Right O
. O

Ed O
you O
know O
, O
there O
is O
no O
right O
answer O
, O
considering O
that O
that O
is O
not O
James O
Mhm O
. O

Ed O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
still O
arguing O
over O
-- O
that O
land O
, O
and O
is O
it O
, O
ah O
James O
Yeah O
. O

Ed O
who O
owns O
it O
and O
respect O
, O
so O
I O
mean O
it's O
James O
Mhm O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
my O
overall O
opinion O
is O
that O
-- O
this O
conflict O
is O
way O
past O
that O
time O
. O

Ed O
Yeah O
, O
well O
, O
James O
You O
know O
, O
it O
's O
been O
going O
on O
for O
all O
these O
many O

what O
, O
Ed O

James O
hundreds O
of O

a O

I O
guess O
time O
will O
tell O
. O

I O
talked O
to O
Secretary O
Powell O
this O
morning O
on O
the O
phone O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
it O
's O
not O
, O
I O
think O
you O
need O
to O
let O
the O
dust O
settle O
on O
that O
. O

He O
's O
, O
in O
my O
judgment O
, O
had O
a O
visit O
that O
was O
worth O
doing O
, O
and O
the O
president O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
what O
progress O
comes O
. O

You O
know O
, O
words O
are O
one O
thing O
, O
actions O
are O
another O
. O

BLITZER O
But O
right O
now O
you O
're O
open-minded O
as O
far O
as O
Syria B-LOC
on O
whether O
they O
will O
crack O
down O
on O
terrorism O
, O
take O
some O
of O
the O
other O
steps O
that O
you O
want O
them O
to O
take O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
know O
what O
they O
've O
been O
doing O
, O
and O
it O
's O
been O
unhelpful O
. O

I O
know O
that O
Secretary O
Powell O
was O
just O
there O
and O
advised O
them O
that O
it O
was O
unhelpful O
, O
and O
gave O
them O
some O
pointers O
and O
some O
suggestions O
for O
the O
future O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
they O
were O
making O
some O
unwise O
decisions O
previously O
. O

What O
they O
'll O
do O
after O
this O
visit O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

BLITZER O
The O
secretary O
of O
state O
has O
written O
you O
a O
letter O
expressing O
, O
apparently O
, O
some O
concern O
about O
the O
length O
that O
the O
prisoners O
are O
going O
to O
be O
spending O
, O
those O
detained O
at O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

Naval O
base O
at O
Guantanamo B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
in O
Cuba B-LOC
, O
about O
600 O
or O
so O
of O
them O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
movement O
in O
trying O
to O
determine O
the O
fate O
of O
these O
individuals O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
's O
quite O
accurate O
as O
to O
what O
he O
wrote O
me O
about O
. O

BLITZER O
All O
right O
, O
tell O
me O
what O
... O
RUMSFELD O
I O
think O
what O
he O
wrote O
me O
about O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
inter-agency O
process O
, O
where O
we O
have O
all O
these O
FBI B-ORG
and O
Department B-ORG
of O
Justice O
and O
CIA B-ORG
and O
DIA B-ORG
, O
and O
what O
have O
you O
, O
involved O
in O
interrogating O
these O
detainees O
, O
it O
takes O
time O
to O
find O
out O
what O
intelligence O
they O
have O
. O

It O
also O
takes O
time O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
law O
enforcement O
process O
might O
be O
appropriate O
, O
and O
what O
Colin O
and O
I O
have O
been O
concerned O
about O
, O
both O
of O
us O
, O
is O
that O
it O
's O
taking O
so O
long O
. O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
countries O
, O
and O
the O
Department B-ORG
of O
State B-ORG
has O
the O
responsibility O
of O
dealing O
with O
those O
countries O
, O
that O
have O
foreign O
nationals O
in O
Gitmo B-LOC
, O
in O
Guantanamo B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
, O
Cuba B-LOC
, O
being O
detained O
, O
and O
those O
countries O
, O
understandably O
, O
would O
like O
to O
know O
when O
they O
could O
have O
those O
people.So O
the O
inter-agency O
process O
takes O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
. O

Colin O
and O
I O
are O
trying O
to O
speed O
up O
that O
process O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
that O
's O
all O
about O
. O

BLITZER O
Let O
me O
just O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
nuggets O
to O
sort O
of O
wrap O
up O
before O
I O
let O
you O
go O
. O

Victory O
parades O
for O
the O
troops O
. O

I O
remember O
covering O
General O
Schwarzkopf O
, O
the O
parades O
in O
Washington B-LOC
and O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
after O
the O
first O
Gulf B-LOC
War O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
the O
troops O
to O
be O
honored O
in O
that O
way O
when O
they O
come O
back O
, O
to O
have O
parades O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
Washington B-LOC
, O
elsewhere O
? O

RUMSFELD O
There O
's O
no O
question O
but O
that O
the O
troops O
, O
the O
young O
men O
and O
women O
, O
did O
such O
a O
superb O
job O
that O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
them O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
. O

And O
General O
Franks O
and O
his O
team O
have O
done O
just O
a O
superb O
job O
for O
our O
country O
and O
for O
the O
world O
, O
and O
indeed O
for O
the O
Iraqi B-LOC
people O
, O
who O
have O
been O
liberated O
. O

What O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
that O
? O

In O
the O
case O
of O
1991 O
, O
the O
task O
was O
to O
go O
in O
and O
get O
them O
out O
of O
Kuwait B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
did O
it O
, O
and O
they O
were O
properly O
greeted O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
different O
task O
. O

It O
was O
to O
remove O
that O
regime O
, O
and O
it O
's O
part O
of O
a O
global O
war O
on O
terrorism O
that O
is O
not O
over O
. O

We O
still O
have O
to O
face O
the O
problem O
of O
a O
number O
of O
global O
terrorist O
networks O
and O
terrorist O
states O
that O
exist O
, O
that O
work O
with O
those O
global O
networks O
. O

And O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
we O
will O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
find O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
the O
courage O
and O
dedication O
and O
talent O
of O
these O
young O
men O
and O
women O
, O
and O
we O
'll O
do O
it O
well O
. O

Whether O
it O
will O
be O
modeled O
off O
the O
1991 O
thing O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
doubt O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
such O
a O
different O
circumstance O
. O

Certainly O
, O
our O
war O
plan O
was O
not O
modeled O
off O
of O
1991 O
. O

BLITZER O
One O
final O
question O
on O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
. O

If O
the O
North B-LOC
Koreans I-LOC
pursue O
their O
nuclear O
weapons O
ambitions O
... O
RUMSFELD O
Yes O
. O

BLITZER O
... O
a O
preemptive O

, O
is O
that O
something O
that O
is O
out O
there O
? O

RUMSFELD O
I O
'm O
not O
one O
who O
speculates O
about O
things O
like O
that O
. O

I O
know O
that O
back O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
in O
the O
Clinton O
administration O
, O
Secretary O
Perry O
called O
in O
the O
former O
secretaries O
of O
defense O
, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
discussion O
, O
and O
they O
clearly O
had O
teed O
up O
a O
military O
option O
that O
they O
were O
considering O
, O
and O
they O
then O
at O
a O
certain O
moment O
were O
able O
to O
do O
some O
things O
that O
persuaded O
them O
that O
that O
was O
not O
appropriate O
. O

But O
those O
are O
very O
serious O
issues O
, O
and O
I O
leave O
them O
for O

As O

WalMart B-ORG

After O

Marco O
Yeah O
, O
okay O
, O
um O
, O
( O
( O
lot O
of O
question O
) O
) O
-- O
and O
, O
um O
, O
I- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
poisoning O
, O
even O
though O
I O
have O
n't O
read O
-- O
a O
lot O
of O
articles O
about O
it O
. O

I O
think- O
Mike O
He- O
he O
was O
old O
. O

I O
mean- O
Marco O
Y- O
he O
was O
old O
, O
yeah O
. O

And- O
-- O
and O
that- O
I- O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
he O
wasn't O
allowed O
to O
be O
buried O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
, O
which- O
Mike O
Yeah O
, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
has O
to O
do O
with O
things O
that O
he O
's O
done O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
He's- O
I O
mean O
, O
like O
, O
you O
know O
, O
let's- O
i- O
-- O
for- O
for O
all O
he O
did O
in O
his O
later O
years O
, O
eh O
, O
Yasser O
Arafat O
was O
responsible O
for O
-- O
a O
good O
chunk O
of O
al- O
you O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
-- O
Israeli O
dying O
-- O
i- O
you O
know O
. O

He O
basically O
, O
eh O
, O
i- O
I O
'm O
completely O
torn O
on O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
on O
one O
hand O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
wrong O
that O
-- O
that O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
~UN B-ORG
just O
kind O
of O
went O
in O
and O
said O
, O
hey O
, O
you O
know O
, O
guess O
what O
? O

You O
know O
, O
we're- O
we're O
you O
know O
, O
this O
is O
Israel B-LOC
now O
, O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
. O

And O
basically O
what O
they O
did O
was O
they O
carved O
up O
the O
region O
and- O
-- O
without O
any O
regard O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
tribal O
-- O
animosity O
really O
, O
is O
really O
what O
it O
boils O
down O
to O
, O
Marco O
Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Mike O
um O
. O

You O
know O
, O
then O
it O
th- O
it O
was O
there O
, O
he O
had O
to O
try O
to O
maintain O
the O
status O
quo O
-- O
but O
they O
bred O
-- O
people O
like O
Yasser O
Arafat O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
if O
it O
-- O
if O
it O
was O
n't O
for O
the O
stupidity O
of O
the O
United B-ORG

, O
people O
like O
Yasser O
Yara- O
Arafat O
w- O
probably O
would O
've O
never O
even O
gotten O
off O

, O
you O
know O

Marco O
How O
how O
did O
the O
United B-ORG

, O
uh O
, O
Arafat O
in O
power O
, O
or O
help O
? O

Mike O
Well O
, O
in O
other O
words O
eh O
, O
in O
other O
-- O
when O
-- O
after O
World O
War O
Two O
when O
they O
when O
-- O
basically O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-LOC
was O
formed O
Marco O
Mhm O
. O

Mike O
in O
f- O
uh O
, O
nineteen O
forty O
eight O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
Um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you- O
e- O
-- O
granted O
, O
you O
know O
, O
there O
were O
there O
were O
Jewish O
people O
already O
living O
there O
, O
but O
-- O
all O
the O
Jewish O
people O
started O
going O
there O
and O
they O
j- O
basically O
just- O
you O
know O
, O
they O
just O
took O
over O
. O

And- O
and O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
in O
in O
a O

where O
, O
uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
y- O
you O
know O
, O
we O
live O
in O
America B-LOC

It O
's O
like O
coup- O
you O

f- O
our O

what O
, O
seventeen O
seventy O
six O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
there O
it O
goes O
, O
you O
know O
, O
thous- O
it O
's O
like O
the O
Hatfields O
and O
the O
McCoys O
. O

They O
're O
fi- O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
why O
they O
're O
fighting O
anymore O
. O

They O
just O
they O
hate O
each O
other O
-- O
and O
they O
're O
always O
going O
to O
hate O
each O
other O
-- O
and O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
who O
started O
it O
, O
but O
-- O
i- O
you O
know O
, O
somebody O
eh O
, O
th- O
somebody O
's O
in O
always O
intent O
on O
winning O
. O

And O
it O
's O
and O
it O
's O
it O
's O
you O
know O
, O
a O
war O
of O
attrition O
. O

Nobody O
wins O
. O

It O
's O
either O
, O
you O
know O
, O
you O
may O
kill O
me O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
kill O
all O
of O
you O
before- O
y- O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

It O
's O
just O
i- O
i- O
it O
's O
stupid O
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
's O
stupid O
. O

And O
a O
guy O
like O
Yasser O
Arafat O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Mike O
he O
was O
a O
terrorist O
. O

In O
in O
the O
sixties O
-- O
in O
the O
mid O
sixties O
an- O
and O
and O
a- O
you O
know O
, O
on O
into- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
through O
the O
mid O
eighties O
-- O
the O
guy O
was O
a O
terrorist O
. O

Marco O
So O
, O
let O
us O
let O
us O
not O
forget O
that O
when O
Israel B-LOC
was O
-- O
formed O
-- O
and O
they O
were O
, O
um O
, O
the O
-- O
the O
Israelis B-LOC
for O
not O
feeling O
-- O
like O
they O
had O
a O
legitimate O
-- O
right O
-- O
some O
of O
the O
land O
or O
that O
-- O
land O
was O
n't O
, O
um O
, O
rightfully O
theirs O
. O

There O
were O
-- O
two O
very O
strong O
-- O
militant O
groups O
that O
were O
Israeli B-LOC
and O
they O
-- O
committed O
a O
lot O
of O
terrorist O
acts O
, O
Mike O
Oh O
, O
the O
yeah O
, O
the O
Zionists B-ORG
. O

Abso- O
absolutely O
. O

Marco O
much O
-- O
Yeah O
. O

So O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
i- O
-- O
you O
know O
, O
uh O
, O
how O
we O
consider O
-- O
Arafat O
a O
terrorist O
, O
we O
also O
should O
consider O
that O
-- O
could O
've O
been O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
a O
reaction O
to O
some O
of O
the O
terrorism O
that O
was O
-- O
initially O
-- O
committed O
by O
the O
Israelis B-LOC
. O

Mike O
Absolutely O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
believe O
me O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
I O
'm O
not O
excusing O
-- O
anybody O
-- O
but O
for O
the O
purpose O
I O
I O
mean O
, O
the O
way O
I O
see O
it O
is O
you O
know O
, O
I O
guess O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
conversation O
th- O
-- O
that O
they O
want O
to O
hear O
, O
Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Mike O
y- O
you O
got O
to O
kind O
of O
have O
to O
put O
that O
as O
y- O
-- O
i- O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
-- O
do O
if O
that O
's O
the O
case O
, O
do O
two O
wrongs O
really O
make O
a O
right O
? O

You O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
? O

Marco O
But O
if O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
been O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
's O
-- O
directly O
-- O
been O
linked O
to O
Hamas B-ORG
' O
acts O
, O
uh O
, O
but O
he O
was O
put O
in O
a O
-- O
pretty O
-- O
sticky O
situation O
having O
to O
negotiate O
-- O
the O
militants O
of O
-- O
Palestine B-LOC
-- O
the O
international O
leaders O
-- O
and O
if O
it O
if O
Hara- O
Arafat O
had O
n't O
-- O
somehow O
appeased O
-- O
the O
Hamas B-ORG
groups O
or O
the O
Palestinian B-LOC
militants O
, O
then O
-- O
he O
would O
've O
been O
kicked O
out O
, O
overthrown O
-- O
by- O
-- O
by O
the O
Palestinians O
. O

Mike O
Oh O
, O
forget O
about O
kicked O
out O
or O
overthrown O
, O
he O
would O
've O
been O
killed O
. O

That's-that O
's O
how O
it O
works O
over O
there O
. O

Marco O
Yeah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
it O
's O
not O
really O
Arafat O
-- O
as O
an O
individual O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
just O
-- O
whatever O
leader O
-- O
is O
-- O
placed O
in O
the O
position O
of- O
Mike O
He O
was O
he O
was O
basically O
-- O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
've O
read O
I O
've O
read O
articles O
an- O
and- O
and- O
and O
-- O
stories O
that O
basically O
have O
linked O
him O
to O
the O
to O
the O
to O
the O
Munich B-LOC
-- O
massacre O
-- O
th- O
you O
know O
, O
the O
Munich B-LOC
Olympic O
massacre O
th- O
the O
Is- O
the O
Israeli B-LOC
team O
. O

It- O
-- O
the O
the O
problem O
is O
-- O
what O
he O
did O
-- O
back O
way O
back O
when O
Marco O
Uh-huh O
. O

Mike O
will O
-- O
f- O
forever O
tarnish O
anything O
that O
he O
did O
-- O
in O
his O
later O
years O
. O

Like O
like O
you O
said O
, O
bringing O
the O
groups O
together O
but O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
them O
together O
is O
because O
he O
was O
once O
one O
of O
them O

There O
is O
one O
Carousel O
organization O
again O
I O
just O
received O
the O
latest O
issue O
of O
Merry-Go-Roundup O
, O
the O
quarterly O
publication O
of O
the O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
. O

In O
it O
was O
a O
blurb O
reporting O
that O
the O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
had O
recently O
disbanded O
. O

Some O
of O
you O
may O
be O
wondering O
why O
there O
were O
two O
carousel O
organizations O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

The O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
was O
founded O
in O
the O
early O
1970 O
's O
by O
a O
group O
of O
art O
historians O
and O
collectors O
, O
including O
Frederick O
Fried O
, O
author O
of O
the O
1964 O
book O
`` O
A O
Pictorial O
History O
of O
The O
Carousel O
'' O
that O
single-handedly O
gave O
the O
classic O
hand-carved O
wooden O
carousel O
the O
respect O
and O
appreciation O
it O
deserved O
. O

Other O
founders O
included O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
, O
who O
was O
already O
a O
major O
collector O
of O
carousel O
artwork O
at O
the O
time O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
is O
`` O
to O
promote O
conservation O
, O
appreciation O
, O
knowledge O
and O
enjoyment O
of O
the O
art O
of O
the O
classic O
wooden O
carousel O
and O
especially O
the O
preservation O
of O
complete O
wooden O
carousels O
. O
'' O

The O
organization O
attracted O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
members O
, O
including O
carousel O
enthusiasts O
, O
owners/operators O
, O
theme O

amusement O

those O
in O
the O
entertainment/recreation O

, O
art O
collectors O
and O
even O
auction O

, O
among O
others O
. O

It O
was O
the O
presence O
of O
these O
last O
two O
named O
groups O
that O
would O
eventually O
stir O
up O
controversy O
. O

Thanks O
in O
large O
part O
to O
the O
NCA B-ORG
, O
the O
art O
of O
the O

was O
receiving O
a O

appreciation O
that O
it O
had O
not O
enjoyed O
before O
. O

However O
, O
this O
new O
and O
brighter O
spotlight O
on O
these O
antique O
rides O
also O
had O
the O
unfortunate O
effect O
of O
enhancing O
the O
collectibility O
and O
monetary O
value O
of O
operational O
carousels O
. O

They O
had O
become O
worth O
more O
money O
dead O
( O
i.e O
. O

in O
pieces O
) O
than O
alive O
( O
i.e O
. O

functioning O
) O
. O

As O
such O
, O
during O
the O
1980 O
's O
many O
beautiful O
and O
unique O
wooden O
carousels O
would O
be O
broken O
up O
at O
the O
auction O
block O
, O
as O
owners O
rushed O
to O
cash O
in O
on O
the O
antique O
marketplace O
. O

The O
liability O
insurance O
crisis O
further O
aggravated O
the O
situation O
, O
as O
amusement O
park O
operators O
sought O
to O
cut O
their O
losses O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
liquidate O
underperforming O
carousels O
to O
raise O
capital O
for O
the O
purchase O
of O
newer O
and O
more O
profitable O
( O
thrill O
) O
rides O
. O

Some O
collectors O
of O
carousel O
art O
and O
auction O
houses O
were O
accused O
of O
using O
their O
NCA B-ORG
affiliation O
to O
gain O
information O
about O
vintage O
carousels O
that O
they O
could O
target O
for O
breakup O
to O
their O
own O
personal O
profit O
, O
a O
practice O
certainly O
contrary O
to O
the O
stated O
goals O
of O
the O
organization O
. O

The O
increasing O
rift O
between O
the O
`` O
preservationists O
'' O
and O
`` O
collectors O
'' O
would O
eventually O
boil O
over O
into O
an O
internal O
political O
struggle O
that O
caused O
many O
in O
the O
collectors O
faction O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
to O
walk O
out O
of O
the O
group O
, O
including O
founders O
such O
as O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
and O
others O
. O

The O
preservationists O
would O
chose O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
NCA B-ORG
, O
including O
Fred O
Fried O
. O

At O
this O
time O
in O
the O
late O
1970 O
's O
, O
carousel O
artwork O
collector O
and O
printer O
Marge O
Swenson O
was O
the O
editor O
of O
the O
NCA B-ORG
's O
Merry-Go-Roundup O
publication O
. O

The O
political O
struggle O
that O
occurred O
within O
the O
NCA B-ORG
resulted O
in O
two O
slates O
of O
officers O
being O
presented O
for O
approval O
to O
the O
membership O
, O
something O
that O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
happen O
. O

A O
thicker-than-usual O
issue O
of O
the O
Roundup O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
accusations O
from O
both O
factions O
in O
the O
group O
each O
accusing O
the O
other O
of O
improper O
behavior O
. O

Swenson O
herself O
would O
also O
leave O
the O
NCA B-ORG
. O

Not O
much O
later O
, O
she O
began O
publishing O
her O
own O
magazine O
called O
`` O
Carousel O
Art O
'' O
, O
which O
was O
essentially O
a O
scholarly O
photo O
album O
depicting O
different O
carvers O
and O
styles O
each O
month O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
those O
collectors O
who O
left O
the O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
banded O
together O
to O
form O
the O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
( O
ACS B-ORG
) O
, O
whose O
stated O
aims O
of O
carousel O
preservation O
also O
recognized O
collectors O
as O
a O
positive O
asset O
towards O
that O
goal O
. O

For O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
decades O
, O
the O
two O
carousel O
organizations O
would O
co-exist O
, O
each O
attracting O
its O
share O
of O
members O
. O

Some O
would O
actually O
join O
both O
groups O
, O
and O
even O
attend O
both O
of O
their O
annual O
conventions O
. O

During O
the O
mid-1980 O
's O
Walter O
Louck O
would O
begin O
publishing O
`` O
The O
Carousel O
Trader O
'' O
, O
later O
renamed O
`` O
The O
Carousel O
News O
& O
amp O
; O
Trader O
'' O
. O

This O
monthly O
magazine O
would O
cover O
all O
angles O
and O
sides O
of O
the O
story O
of O
the O
carousel O
and O
be O
well O
received O
by O
all O
carousel O
enthusiasts O
. O

About O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
Carousel O
Art O
would O
suddenly O
cease O
publication O
. O

The O
NCA B-ORG
would O
continue O
to O
issue O
the O
Roundup O
to O
its O
members O
. O

The O
mid O
to O
late O
1990 O
's O
saw O
the O
passing O
of O
NCA B-ORG
founder O
Fred O
Fried O
, O
and O
also O
that O
of O
Charlotte O
Dinger O
, O
both O
who O
represented O
the O
two O
opposite O
points O
of O
view O
in O
the O
carousel O
preservation O
debate O
. O

Coincidentally O
and O
amazingly O
, O
the O
art O
of O
building O
hand-carved O
carousels O
( O
and O
even O
bandorgans O
) O
has O
been O
revived O
, O
with O
firms O
such O
as O
Carousel B-ORG
Works I-ORG
and O
Carousel B-ORG
Magic I-ORG
again O
building O
the O
popular O
rides O
in O
classic O
design O
. O

This O
development O
seems O
to O
have O
greatly O
alleviated O
the O
antique O
marketplace O
pressures O
that O
have O
doomed O
so O
many O
legacy O
wooden O
carousels O
over O
the O
past O
several O
decades O
. O

The O
turn O
of O
the O
new O
millenium O
actually O
witnessesed O
a O
thaw O
in O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
National B-ORG
Carousel O
Association B-ORG
and O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
, O
as O
newer O
and O
younger O
leadership O
took O
over O
from O
the O
founding O
generation O
. O

The O
two O
groups O
decided O
that O
the O
bickering O
between O
them O
was O
wasteful O
, O
conterproductive O
and O
pointless O
. O

There O
was O
talk O
of O
a O
( O
re O
) O
merger O
but O
the O
regulations O
governing O
non-profits O
prevented O
that O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
NCA B-ORG
and O
ACS B-ORG
hold O
joint O
conventions O
to O
save O
on O
costs O
to O
both O
the O
clubs O
and O
the O
members O
. O

Just O
within O
the O
past O
couple O
of O
months O
though O
, O
the O
American B-ORG
Carousel O
Society B-ORG
had O
determined O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
the O
funding O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
operation O
of O
their O
organization O
and O
officially O
ceased O
to O
exist O
. O

So O
now O
, O
once O
again O
there O
is O
a O
single O
nationwide O
organization O
to O
join O
if O
you O
love O
carousels O

Yes O
, O
but O
according O
to O
the O
facts O
you O
first O
gave O
, O
he O
had O
not O
yet O
received O
the O
bankruptcy O
discharge O
when O
you O
gave O
him O
the O
shares O
. O

I O
believe O
you O
had O
said O
that O
you O
gave O
him O
the O
shares O
in O
February O
2004 O
but O
that O
the O
discharge O
did O
n't O
come O
until O
June O
of O
2004 O
. O

That O
means O
that O
he O
received O
the O
shares O
while O
he O
was O
still O
in O
bankruptcy O
, O
which O
means O
that O
the O
shares O
were O
potentially O
assets O
that O
the O
trustee O
could O
use O
to O
pay O
off O
creditors O
. O

A O
bankruptcy O
case O
does O
n't O
close O
until O
you O
get O
the O
discharge O
order O
, O
and O
until O
then O
everything O
that O
the O
debtor O
receives O
is O
fair O
game O
for O
the O
trustee O
. O

If O
the O
trustee O
was O
informed O
of O
the O
shares O
and O
did O
nothing O
about O
it O
, O
you O
are O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
ok O
, O
but O
if O
the O
trustee O
was O
n't O
informed O
of O
the O
fact O
directly O
, O
then O
you O
may O
be O
in O
trouble O
. O

If O
, O
however O
, O
your O
uncle O
received O
the O
shares O
after O
he O
obtained O
an O
order O
of O
discharge O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
court O
, O
then O
as O
a O
general O
matter O
the O
creditors O
can O
not O
go O
after O
the O
shares O
, O
unless O
they O
can O
prove O
that O
there O
was O
collusion O
between O
you O
and O
your O
uncle O
to O
hide O
his O

Will O

I O

with O
your O
analysis O
, O
the O
VA B-LOC
business O
community O
along O
with O
a O
majority O
of O

will O
probably O
deep-six O
this O
5-year O

If O
not O
bordering O
on O

ridorkulous O
( O

, O
it O
's O
just O
plain O

agree O

it O

not O

The O
Commonwealth B-LOC
needs O
legislation O
that O

a O
mandatory O
Employee O
Stock O

Plan O
( O
ESOP O
) O
within O
the O
contractual O
economic O

The O
ESOP O
is O
itself O
a O
corporate O

vehicle O
that O
provides O
monetary O

with O

institutes O

But O
most O

, O
how O
many O
Virginia B-LOC

will O
choose O
to O
relocate O
-- O
or O
outsource O
when O

And O
lets O
say O
the O
business O
has O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
remove O
to O
the O
third O
world O
... O

When O
Virginia B-LOC

employees O
are O
fully O
vested O
in O
company O

, O
they O
will O
also O
reap O
from O

Curt O
American O
Future O
has O
a O
link O
up O
to O
a O
article O
written O
in O
yesterdays O
Houston B-ORG
Chronicle I-ORG
. O

It O
describes O
how O
the O
European B-LOC
Governments O
look O
to O
be O
changing O
their O
tune O
in O
regards O
to O
President O
Bush O
. O

Why O
you O
ask O
? O

But O
there O
is O
arguably O
more O
to O
this O
sea O
change O
than O
just O
a O
grumpy O
acceptance O
of O
the O
status O
quo O
. O

From O
a O
European B-LOC
perspective O
, O
three O
things O
are O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
warm O
to O
the O
Bush O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

One O
is O
the O
death O
of O
Yasser O
Arafat O
. O

No O
issue O
divides O
Europe B-LOC
and O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
more O
keenly O
than O
the O
Israeli-Palestinian B-LOC
dispute O
. O

For O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
Europeans O
have O
criticized O
Bush O
for O
failing O
to O
put O
enough O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-LOC
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
occupied O
territories O
and O
for O
refusing O
to O
deal O
with O
Arafat O
. O

That O
another O
reason O
why O
I O
respect O
Bush O
so O
much O
, O
his O
refusal O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
windbag O
terrorist O
Arafat O
. O

May O
he O
rot O
in O
hell O
. O

But O
since O
Arafat O
's O
death O
, O
Europeans O
and O
Americans O
have O
been O
able O
to O
find O
common O
ground O
: O
supporting O
Ariel O
Sharon O
's O
withdrawal O
from O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
putting O
pressure O
on O
Israel B-LOC
to O
let O
the O
Palestinians O
hold O
elections O
and O
, O
covertly O
, O
backing O
Mahmoud O
Abbas O
to O
become O
the O
next O
Palestinian B-LOC
leader O
. O

A O
second O
reason O
is O
Europe B-LOC
's O
growing O
worries O
about O
Islamic O
terrorism O
. O

The O
murder O
in O
November O
of O
Theo O
van O
Gogh O
, O
a O
provocative O
Dutch B-LOC
filmmaker O
, O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
an O
Islamic O
militant O
has O
been O
called O
Europe B-LOC
's O
9/11 O
. O

Though O
the O
two O
events O
are O
obviously O
not O
fully O
comparable O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
true O
that O
American B-LOC
conservatives O
, O
such O
as O
Francis O
Fukuyama O
and O
Bernard O
Lewis O
, O
have O
found O
a O
wider O
audience O
recently O
for O
the O
idea O
that O
radical O
Islam O
is O
inimical O
to O
European B-LOC
traditions O
of O
tolerance O
. O

You O
mean O
those O
radical O
muslims O
can O
be O
kinda O
nasty O
sometimes O
? O

Get O
outta O
here O
... O
.Keep O
doing O
business O
like O
the O
cowards O
in O
Spain B-LOC
and O
they O
will O
more O
then O
likely O
have O
their O
very O
own O
9/11 O
to O
cry O
about O
. O

The O
third O
force O
is O
the O
reappearance O
, O
albeit O
in O
a O
milder O
form O
, O
of O
the O
threat O
that O
kept O
the O
trans-Atlantic O
alliance O
together O
for O
half O
a O
century O
. O

The O
Russian B-LOC
bear O
is O
growling O
again O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-LOC
election O
-- O
- O
complete O
with O
its O
KGB-style B-ORG
poisoning O
of O
the O
opposition O
leader O
and O
heavy-handed O
electoral O
fraud O
-- O
has O
reminded O
European B-LOC
diplomats O
of O
Vladimir O
V. O
Putin O
's O
determination O
to O
control O
his O
`` O
near O
abroad O
. O
'' O

They O
should O
be O
very O
worried O
about O
this O
item O
, O
I O
believe O
Putin O
is O
slowly O
sliding O
Russia B-LOC
back O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
. O

Hopefully O
our O
Government O
is O
n't O
asleep O
at O
the O
wheel O
with O
this O
situation O
either O
. O

There O
is O
a O
personal O
edge O
to O
all O
this O
. O

Just O
as O
the O
snooty O
continentals O
eventually O
came O
to O
admire O
the O
gormless O
Hollywood B-ORG
actor O
, O
there O
is O
a O
grudging O
willingness O
to O
rethink O
some O
prejudices O
about O
the O
inarticulate O
Texan O
. O

Many O
European B-LOC
leaders O
once O
swallowed O
the O
Michael O
Moore O
version O
of O
history O
: O
that O
Bush O
was O
an O
ignorant O
interloper O
who O
stole O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

His O
thumping O
re-election O
, O
however O
, O
shows O
that O
he O
represents O
a O
large O
body O
of O
conservative O
American O
opinion O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Europeans O
are O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
is O
not O
Bush O
who O
is O
the O
exception O
, O
but O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. O

itself O
that O
is O
exceptional O
-- O
- O
and O
that O
if O
they O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
exceptional O
superpower O
they O
need O
to O
humor O
it O
rather O
than O
rile O
it O
. O

Strangely O
enough O
, O
this O
has O
been O
Tony O
Blair's O
strategy O
all O
along O
; O
it O
is O
rapidly O
becoming O
the O

too O

Could O

the O

of O

If O
these O

meet O

thousands O

If O

which O

Diane O
a O

then O
I O
've O
let O
them O

recommend O
family O

, O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
a O

good O

they O
're O

recommending O

And O
I O

a O

they O

of O
that O

Mogadishu B-LOC

the O

that O

Not O

And O
one O
of O
the O

we O

we O

use O

The O

And O
we O
also O

We O
are O

've O
depicted O
here O
is O
something O
here O
which O
shows O
some O
armor O
sort O
of O
off O
the O
wings O
here O
, O
right O
over O
here O
is O
a O
mosque O
. O

We O
depict O
that O
to O
show O
that O
's O
something O
you O
obviously O
want O
to O
stay O
clear O
as O
we O
just O
saw O
with O
the O
Ryan O
Chilcote O
piece O
from O
Najaf B-LOC
. O

As O
we O
get O
a O
little O
bit O
closer O
here O
, O
in O
a O
typical O
scenario O
like O
this O
, O
you O
might O
very O
well O
have O
Republican B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
snipers O
up O
on O
balconies O
like O
this O
, O
and O
possibly O
up O
on O
the O
roofs O
of O
buildings O
and O
anti-aircraft O
artillery O
or O
artillery O
encampments O
like O
that O
. O

What O
we O
have O
presented O
her O
is O
an O
armored O
column O
with O
air O
support O
coming O
in O
. O

How O
much O
jeopardy O
is O
a O
column O
like O
this O
in O
as O
it O
goes O
through O
these O
concrete O
canyons O
in O
a O
city O
? O

LEONHARD O
It O
's O
a O
great O
question O
. O

I O
think O
the O
animation O
is O
good O
because O
it O
does O
show O
that O
you O
can O
hide O
literally O
anywhere O
in O
a O
city O
environment O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
movement O
through O
an O
urban O
area O
is O
very O
, O
very O
dangerous O
. O

It O
's O
the O
side O
that O
's O
moving O
that O
's O
going O
to O
take O
the O
casualties O
. O

That O
said O
, O
the O
armored O
fighting O
vehicles O
that O
you O
see O
there O
they O
look O
to O
me O
as O
if O
they O
're O
moving O
a O
little O
bit O
faster O
as O
than O
we O
probably O
will O
. O

We O
'll O
use O
patience O
and O
finesse O
. O

We O
will O
take O
the O
time O
to O
locate O
the O
enemy O
, O
surround O
the O
blocks O
and O
the O
buildings O
that O
he O
is O
in O
. O

And O
then O
we O
'll O
probably O
surge O
fires O
into O
their O
both O
lethal O
and O
nonlethal O
to O
make O
his O
position O
untenable O
, O
to O
make O
him O
move O
rather O
than O
us O
moving O
through O
the O
assault O
zone O
. O

At O
which O
time O
we O
can O
engage O
them O
or O
arrest O
them O
. O

O'BRIEN O
We O
'd O
like O
to O
resume O
with O
that O
animation O
if O
we O
could O
. O

That O
's O
Saddam O
International O
Airport O
. O

That O
's O
another O
segment O
. O

Can O
we O
get O
back O
to O
the O
animation O
. O

And O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
just O
finish O
this O
out O
. O

Here O
we O
go O
. O

Ad O
we O
move O
it O
along O
, O
you O
'll O
see O
eventually O
the O
troops O
will O
come O
marching O
in O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
slightly O
off O
target O
here O
because O
you O
see O
them O
all O
going O
in O
the O
front O
door O
. O

Typically O
, O
when O
they O
'd O
assault O
a O
target O
like O
this O
, O
they O
'd O
do O
what O
? O

LEONHARD O
Well O
, O
typically O
, O
if O
they O
do O
go O
in O
, O
which O
is O
generally O
the O
option O
of O
last O
resort O
, O
but O
if O
we O
do O
have O
to O
go O
in O
, O
often O
we O
'll O
try O
to O
go O
in O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
building O
down O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
is O
because O
we O
use O
grenades O
a O
lot O
in O
clearing O
buildings O
, O
and O
grenades O
ten O
to O
offend O
downhill O
rather O
than O
uphill O
. O

So O
, O
you O
always O
want O
them O
going O
down O
staircases O
rather O
than O
having O
to O
try O
to O
throw O
them O
up O
the O
staircase O
. O

O'BRIEN O
Interesting O
, O
all O
right O
. O

Gravity O
rules O
, O
even O
in O
urban O
combat O
. O

Lieutenant O
Colonel O
Robert O
Leonard O

we O
appreciate O

something O
that O

U.S B-LOC
. O

would O
prefer O
to O
engage O
in O
, O
but O
it O
might O

avoid O

if O
for O

they O

We O
all O

But O
three O

a O

They O
are O

200 O

With O
roughly O
three O
million O
votes O
cast O
in O
the O
race O
, O
the O
margin O
of O
victory O
was O
a O
few O
ten O
thousands O
of O
one O
percent O
or O
some O
such O
microscopic O
amount O
. O

For O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
it O
was O
a O
tie- O
but O
somebody O
had O
to O
end O
up O
with O
a O
few O
more O
votes O
and O
this O
time O
around O
it O
was O
the O
demos O
. O

The O
same O
group O
of O
people O
who O
have O
said O
`` O
even O
if O
some O
regions O
are O
too O
unsafe O
for O

to O
go O
to O
the O

and O
even O
if O
large O
portions O

the O

will O
not O
recognize O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
the O

, O
some O

better O

and O
it O

a O

`` O

overthrow O

of O
the O

Washington B-LOC

because O
there O
were O
some O
'' O

in O
the O

( O
They O
hollered O
`` O

until O

but O
unable O

find O

with O
which O
to O

that O
charge O
they O
have O
backed O
down O
to O
`` O

) O

So O
the O
standards O
are O
: O
Any O
old O
process O
halfway O
resembling O
an O
election O
is O
just O
diddly O
dandy O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
accept O
the O
results O
of O
a O
free O
and O
fair O
election O
in O
Washington B-LOC
State I-LOC
because O
there O
may O
have O
been O
a O
human O
error O
rate O
of O
0.0000001 O
percent O
. O

In O
Washington B-LOC
State I-LOC
, O
the O
election O
has O
to O
be O
not O
only O
free O
and O
fair O
, O
but O
also O
`` O
perfect O
'' O
. O

( O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
Republicans B-ORG
would O
have O
thought O
the O
WA B-LOC
State I-LOC
election O
*was* O
perfect O
, O
had O
their O
candidate O
held O
the O
same O
100 O
and O
some O
vote O
margin O
when O
all O
the O
smoke O
finally O
cleared O
) O
. O

Funny O
how O
the O
standards O
change O

and O
so O
easily O

depending O

what O

happen O
in O
the O

which O
is O
just O
over O
29 O

is O
being O

which O
should O
be O
an O

to O

However O
, O
In O
the O
two O
times O
the O
game O
has O
been O
played O
in O
Bryant O
Denny O

, O
Auburn B-ORG
has O

Alabama B-ORG
has O
one O
of O
the O
stingiest O
defenses O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
were O
ranked O
number O
one O
in O
overall O
defense O
as O
recently O
as O
last O
week O
. O

Conversely O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
has O
one O
of O
the O
most O
potent O
and O
balanced O
offensive O
attacks O
in O
the O
nation O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Bama B-ORG
has O
faced O
an O
attack O
with O
two O
great O
runners O
, O
a O
great O
line O
, O
a O
poised O
QB O
and O
good O
receivers O
and O
a O
tight O
end O
as O
well O
. O

Bama B-ORG
is O
missing O
it O
's O
starting O
offensive O
backfield O
from O
the O
start O
of O
the O
season O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
they O
've O
won O
six O
games O
is O
a O
testament O
to O
the O
coaching O
and O
heart O
of O
the O
players O
. O

Alabama B-ORG
simply O
can O
not O
throw O
the O
football O
, O
which O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
because O
Auburn B-ORG
's O
defensive O
backfield O
is O
second O
to O
none O
. O

Bama B-ORG
can O
run O
the O
ball O
however O
. O

Unfortunately O
for O
them O
, O
with O
no O
passing O
game O
to O
keep O
the O
defense O
honest O
, O
Auburn B-ORG
will O
probably O
stack O
nine O
in O
the O
box O
, O
play O
man O
on O
the O
corners O
, O
and O
dare O
Bama B-ORG
to O
run O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Auburn B-ORG
is O
also O
9-0 O
when O
they O
score O
first O
. O

The O
Tuberville O
way O
is O
to O
get O
one O
quick O
and O
early O
to O
get O
your O

it O

the O

I O

losing O

Alabama B-ORG

what O

If O

we O

this O

some O

i O
'll O
try O

the O
best O
i O
can O
from O
what O

remember O
from O
being O
on O

`` O

abraham O

this O
is O
an O
amphibious O

, O
rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
navy O
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

everybody O
that O
is O
, O
every O
sailor O
that's O
entersing O
the O
navy O
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

they O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
. O

also O
drills O
take O
place O
before O
sailors O
get O
on O
to O
any O
ship O
, O
before O
any O
deployment O
, O
usually O
twice O
a O

, O
they O
're O
practicing O
man O

drills O
, O
knowing O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
report O
to O
if O
indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

they O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

you O
can O
see O
them O
here O

the O
yellow O

is O
wearing O
a O

everything O
is O

you O

the O

here O
wearing O

and O
they O
have O

to O
pull O

they O
also O
have O

if O
the O

they O
can O
blow O

they O

they O

it O

also O
such O
location O
devices O
, O
some O
ship O
have O
smoke O
floats O
they O
can O
toss O
out O
so O
the O

will O
be O

smoke O

as O
a O
way O
of O
trying O
to O
find O

, O
let O
the O

locate O
them O

also O
24/7 O
there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
. O

all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O

and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O

most O

of O
the O

, O
not O
on O

all O

the O

but O
on O
most O

there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O

now O

talk O
about O
the O
man O

rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O

situation O
. O

you O
will O
hear O
a O
p.a O
. O

announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
. O

there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

a O
ship-wide O
search O
will O
happen O
f. O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
imswimmers O
. O

if O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

if O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about O
24 O
hours O
. O

the O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 O
hours O
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

there O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
possible O
that O
or O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24-hour O
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O
. O

anyway O
, O
we O
'll O

what O

Mark O
Backer O
Sorry O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
posting O
much O
lately O
. O

We O
have O
been O
so O
damned O
busy O
with O
the O
holidays O
( O
that O
's O
what O
we O
call O
December O
at O
our O
house O
) O
that O
I O
just O
have O
n't O
had O
time O
. O

I O
read O
a O
funny O
joke O
today O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
'd O
share O
it O
with O
you O
. O

One O
of O
my O
fellow O
eggers O
posted O
it O
, O
so O
Chet O
, O
here O
's O
your O
credit O
: O
A O
traveler O
was O
driving O
through O
Arkansas B-LOC
when O
he O
lost O
his O
way O
and O
got O
off O
the O
main O
highway O
. O

As O
he O
drove O
by O
, O
he O
saw O
rows O
and O
rows O
of O
pigsties O
and O
pigpens O
and O
pigs O
running O
in O
fields O
and O
pigs O
wallowing O
in O
mud O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
his O
eye O
caught O
something O
really O
strange O
. O

He O
did O
a O
double O
take O
, O
muttered O
to O
himself O
and O
then O
looked O
a O
third O
time O
. O

He O
wondered O
if O
he O
had O
seen O
correctly O
- O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
pig O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
! O

He O
found O
the O
lane O
to O
the O
farm O
and O
drove O
up O
into O
the O
farmyard O
, O
where O
he O
was O
met O
by O
the O
farmer O
. O

`` O
Excuse O
me O
, O
'' O
the O
traveler O
said O
. O

`` O
I O
was O
just O
driving O
by O
and O
looking O
at O
all O
your O
pigs O
, O
and O
I O
noticed O
something O
that O
I O
just O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
ask O
about O
. O

Tell O
me O
, O
did O
I O
see O
right O
? O

Is O
there O
really O
a O
pig O
out O
there O
with O
a O
wooden O
leg O
? O
'' O

The O
farmer O
smiled O
. O

`` O
Oh O
, O
that O
would O
be O
old O
Caesar O
you O
saw O
. O

He O
's O
the O
finest O
pig O
a O
man O
could O
ever O
hope O
to O
have O
- O
and O
smart O
! O

Well O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
a O
little O
about O
that O
pig O
. O

You O
see O
that O
barge O
down O
there O
on O
the O
river O
? O

That O
's O
a O
mining O
dredge O
, O
taking O
out O
platinum O
ore. O
Old O
Caesar O
sniffed O
out O
the O
vein O
and O
showed O
us O
how O
to O
set O
it O
up O
. O

Now O
that O
dredge O
brings O
me O
in O
about O
$ O
120,000 O
every O
year O
. O

`` O
There O
's O
another O
thing O
, O
too O
, O
a O
little O
more O
personal O
. O

One O
night O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
I O
got O
to O
drinking O
and O
I O
guess O
I O
had O
more O
than O
I O
should O
have O
. O

I O
passed O
out O
drunk O
, O
fell O
down O
and O
knocked O
over O
a O
lamp O
. O

That O
started O
a O
fire O
in O
the O
house O
and O
old O
Caesar O
smelled O
the O
smoke O
. O

He O
came O
in O
the O
back O
door O
, O
got O
the O
wife O
and O
kid O
out O
, O
roused O
me O
up O
and O
got O
me O
out O
. O

`` O
There O
is O
no O
question O
about O
it O
- O
that O
night O
old O
Caesar O
saved O
all O
our O
lives O
and O
you O
know O
that O
is O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
a O
man O
is O
going O
to O
forget O
too O
easily O
. O
'' O

`` O
Why O
, O
'' O
the O
traveler O
said O
, O
`` O
this O
is O
all O
amazing O
! O

I O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
pig O
like O
this O
before O
! O

This O
is O
fantastic O
! O

But O
tell O
me O
, O
how O
did O
he O
get O
that O
wooden O
leg O
? O

Was O
he O
in O
a O
wreck O
or O
something O
? O
'' O

The O
farmer O
laughed O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
Well O
, O
naturally O
, O
when O
you O
have O
a O
pig O
that O
smart O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
eat O
him O
all O
at O
one O
time O

reporter O
: O
well O
, O
lou O
, O
one O
thing O
that O
the O
coroner O
has O
been O
able O
to O
determine O
is O
that O
the O
skeletal O

are O
those O
of O
one O

an O
adult O
female O
, O
and O
two O
, O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full-term O
baby O
boy O
. O

and O
of O
course O
, O
this O
is O
significant O
because O
laci O
peterson O
, O
when O
she O
disappeared O
from O
her O
modesto B-LOC
home O
, O
was O
7 O
1/2 O
months O
pregnant O
. O

that O
was O
on O
christmas O
eve O

her O
husband O
, O
scott O
, O
at O
the O
time O
said O
that O
he O
was O
fishing O
in O
the O
berkeley B-LOC

now O
, O
in O
a O
strange O
twist O
in O
all O
of O
this O
, O
just O
yesterday O
separate O
from O
the O
skeletal O
remains O
i O
alluded O
to O
earlier O
a O
man O
hiking O
near O
the O
berkeley B-LOC
marina I-LOC
found O
a O
bone O
, O
and O
they O
are O
now O
looking O
at O
that O
as O
another O
possible O
lead O
in O
this O
case O
. O

this O
person O
came O
across O
the O
bone O
at O
the O
shore O
. O

he O
brought O
it O
home O
and O
contacted O
the O
authorities O
, O
and O
we O
took O
possession O
of O
it O
. O

and O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
connect O
it O
to O
the O
other O
-- O
well O
, O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
find O
out O
if O
it O
's O
a O
human O
bone O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
is O
related O
to O
the O
others O
. O

reporter O
: O
and O
yet O
another O
reason O
why O
that O
bone O
could O
be O
a O
key O
link O
, O
there O
are O
reports O
that O
have O
surfaced O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
female O
remains O
that O
were O
found O
the O
skeleton O
was O
not O
completely O
intact O
. O

now O
this O
case O
is O
also O
taking O
on O
a O
rather O
, O
we O
should O
say O
, O
almost O
a O
tv O
episodic O
forensic O
pathology O
angle O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
bring O
in O
an O
expert O
on O
what O
's O
called O
alufating O
decay O
, O
and O
basically O
this O
person O
is O
going O
to O
come O
in O
here O
and O
look O
at O
the O
body O
. O

this O
is O
in O
the O
damage O
aspect O
of O
it O
. O

and O
they O
say O
these O
experts O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
how O
long O
the O
body O
had O
been O
in O
there O
and O
if O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
almost O
full-term O
baby O
boy O
were O
inside O
the O
female O
's O
remains O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
. O

also O
, O
the O
coroner O
could O
know O
right O
now O
but O
is O
not O
saying O
if O
there O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
trauma O
to O
either O
of O
these O
skeletons O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
they O
could O
see O
the O
bone O
compromised O
in O
some O
way O
they O
could O
tell O
if O
there O
had O
been O
a O
stab O
or O
a O
shooting O
. O

we O
may O
learn O
a O
lot O
more O
on O
this O
in O
just O
15 O
minutes O
. O

that O
's O
because O
modesto B-LOC

have O
scheduled O
a O
news O

while O
they O
may O
not O

you O

if O

, O
quickly O
, O
are O
we O
expecting O
-- O
is O
there O
any O
reason O
for O
us O
to O
expect O
that O
there O
would O
be O
the O
ability O
to O
identify O
those O
remains O
as O
a O
result O
of O
these O
autopsies O
this O
afternoon O
? O

reporter O
: O
it O
sounds O
like O
all O
of O
this O
will O
be O
too O
quick O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
underlying O
all O
this O
is O
there O
could O
be O
an O
absence O
of O
dental O
records O
. O

that O
's O
particularly O
important O
for O
the O
adult O
female O
remains O
. O

so O
now O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
turn O
to O
dna O
, O
and O
that O
's O
why O
they O
're O
calling O
in O
these O
experts O
. O

some O
dna O
testing O
can O
be O
very O
quick O
, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
can O
take O
up O
to O
weeks O
, O
even O
more O
, O

. O

okay O
